# Add-Acctidentitypoolscope
Add the specified IdentityPool(s) to the given scope(s).
## Syntax
```
Add-AcctIdentityPoolScope [-Scope] <String[]> -InputObject <IdentityPool[]> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Add-AcctIdentityPoolScope [-Scope] <String[]> -IdentityPoolUid <Guid[]> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Add-AcctIdentityPoolScope [-Scope] <String[]> -IdentityPoolName <String[]> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
The Add-AcctIdentityPoolScope command is used to associate one or more IdentityPool objects with given scope(s).

There are multiple parameter sets for this cmdlet, allowing you to identify the IdentityPool objects in different ways: - IdentityPool objects can be piped in or specified by the InputObject parameter - The IdentityPoolUid parameter specifies objects by IdentityPoolUid - The IdentityPoolName parameter specifies objects by IdentityPoolName (supports wildcards)

To add a IdentityPool to a scope you need permission to change the scopes of the IdentityPool and permission to add objects to all of the scopes you have specified.

If the IdentityPool is already in a scope, that scope will be silently ignored.
