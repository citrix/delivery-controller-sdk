# Add-AcctIdentityPoolScope

   Add the specified IdentityPool(s) to the given scope(s).

## Syntax
```
Add-AcctIdentityPoolScope [-Scope] <String[]> -InputObject <IdentityPool[]> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Add-AcctIdentityPoolScope [-Scope] <String[]> -IdentityPoolUid <Guid[]> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Add-AcctIdentityPoolScope [-Scope] <String[]> -IdentityPoolName <String[]> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## Detailed Description
   The Add-AcctIdentityPoolScope command is used to associate one or more IdentityPool objects with given scope(s).

There are multiple parameter sets for this cmdlet, allowing you to identify the IdentityPool objects in different ways: 
 - IdentityPool objects can be piped in or specified by the InputObject parameter 
 - The IdentityPoolUid parameter specifies objects by IdentityPoolUid 
 - The IdentityPoolName parameter specifies objects by IdentityPoolName (supports wildcards)

To add a IdentityPool to a scope you need permission to change the scopes of the IdentityPool and permission to add objects to all of the scopes you have specified.

If the IdentityPool is already in a scope, that scope will be silently ignored.

## Parameters

| Name   | Description | Required? | Pipeline Input | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Scope | Specifies the scopes to add the objects to. | true | false |  |
| InputObject | Specifies the IdentityPool objects to be added. | true | true (ByValue, ByPropertyName) |  |
| IdentityPoolUid | Specifies the IdentityPool objects to be added by IdentityPoolUid. | true | true (ByValue, ByPropertyName) |  |
| IdentityPoolName | Specifies the IdentityPool objects to be added by IdentityPoolName. | true | true (ByValue, ByPropertyName) |  |
| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high-level operation this cmdlet call forms a part of. Citrix Studio and Director typically create high-level operations. PowerShell scripts can also wrap a series of cmdlet calls in a high-level operation by way of the Start-LogHighLevelOperation and Stop-LogHighLevelOperation cmdlets. | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller the PowerShell snap-in will connect to. You can provide this as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | Localhost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value becomes the default. |
