# Get-AcctInstalledDBVersion

   Gets a list of all available database schema versions for the ADIdentity Service.

## Syntax
```
Get-AcctInstalledDBVersion [-Upgrade] [-Downgrade] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## Detailed Description
   Gets the current version number of the Citrix ADIdentity Service database schema when called with no parameters.

When called with the -Upgrade parameter, gets the service schema version numbers to which an upgrade could be performed.

When called with the -Downgrade parameter, gets the service schema version numbers to which a downgrade could be performed.

The SQL scripts to perform schema upgrades and downgrades can be obtained using the Get-AcctDBVersionChangeScript cmdlet. Citrix recommends that where possible service schema upgrades are performed using Studio rather than manually via the SDK.

Only one of the -Upgrade or -Downgrade parameters may be supplied at once.
