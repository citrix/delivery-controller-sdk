## Detailed Description
Provides the ability to remove AD accounts from an identity pool.  This removes the AD account from the Citrix service management scope.  This process provides the options for removing the account in AD (or disabling it) if required.

All aspects of this command that need to make modifications to the accounts in AD will use the account that the runspace is using.  This means that if an account is to be removed from AD or disabled, the user performing the operation in PowerShell must have sufficient privileges in AD for this operation to complete successfully.

If the option to remove the account from AD or to disable it in AD is specified, the AD operation must succeed for the account to be removed from the Citrix AD Identity Service database. Use caution when using the Force parameter because this allows removal of accounts that are in the 'inUse' state, which may result in the machines becoming unusable.

| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high-level operation this cmdlet call forms a part of. Citrix Studio and Director typically create high-level operations.
