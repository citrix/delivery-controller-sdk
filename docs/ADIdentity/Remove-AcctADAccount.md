## Detailed Description
   Provides the ability to remove AD accounts from an identity pool.  This removes the AD account from the Citrix service management scope.  This process provides the options for removing the account in AD (or disabling it) if required.

All aspects of this command that need to make modifications to the accounts in AD will use the account that the runspace is using.  This means that if an account is to be removed from AD or disabled, the user performing the operation in PowerShell must have sufficient privileges in AD for this operation to complete successfully.

If the option to remove the account from AD or to disable it in AD is specified, the AD operation must succeed for the account to be removed from the Citrix AD Identity Service database. Use caution when using the Force parameter because this allows removal of accounts that are in the 'inUse' state, which may result in the machines becoming unusable.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IdentityPoolName | The identity pool that the accounts are to be removed from. | true | false |  |
| ADAccountName | The AD account name to be removed. AD accounts are accepted in the following formats: Fully qualified DN e.g. CN=MyComputer,OU=Computers,DC=MyDomain,DC=Com; UPN format e.g MyComputer@MyDomain.Com; Domain qualified e.g MyDomain\MyComputer. | true | false |  |
| ADAccountSid | The Active Directory Account SID for the account to be removed. | true | true (ByPropertyName) |  |
| IdentityPoolUid | The unique identifier for the identity pool that the accounts are to be removed from. | true | true (ByPropertyName) |  |
| ADUserName | The username for an Active Directoy user account with Write Permissions. This parameter is only used in Cloud deployments. | false | false |  |
| ADPassword | The matching password for an Active Directoy user account with Write Permissions. This parameter is only used in Cloud deployments. | false | false |  |
| RemovalOption | Defines the behavior relating to the AD account.<br>None - Do not attempt to remove the account from AD Delete - Attempt to remove the account from AD Disable - Attempt to disable the account in AD | false | false | None |
| Force | Indicates if accounts that are marked as 'in-use' can be removed. | false | false |  |
| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high-level operation this cmdlet call forms a part of. Citrix Studio and Director typically create high-level operations. PowerShell scripts can also wrap a series of cmdlet calls in a high-level operation by way of the Start-LogHighLevelOperation and Stop-LogHighLevelOperation cmdlets. | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller that the PowerShell snap-in connects to.  You can provide this as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | LocalHost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value becomes the default. |
