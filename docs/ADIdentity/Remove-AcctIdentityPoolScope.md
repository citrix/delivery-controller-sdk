## Syntax
```
Remove-AcctIdentityPoolScope [-Scope] <String[]> -InputObject <IdentityPool[]> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Remove-AcctIdentityPoolScope [-Scope] <String[]> -IdentityPoolUid <Guid[]> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

## Detailed Description
The Remove-AcctIdentityPoolScope command is used to remove one or more IdentityPool objects from the given scope(s).

There are multiple parameter sets for this cmdlet, allowing you to identify the IdentityPool objects in different ways: - IdentityPool objects can be piped in or specified by the InputObject parameter - The IdentityPoolUid parameter specifies objects by IdentityPoolUid - The IdentityPoolName parameter specifies objects by IdentityPoolName (supports wildcards)

To remove a IdentityPool from a scope you need permission to change the scopes of the IdentityPool.

If the IdentityPool is not in a specified scope, that scope will be silently ignored.
