# Repair-AcctADAccount

   Resets the Active Directory machine password for the given accounts.

## Syntax
```
Repair-AcctADAccount -ADAccountName <String[]> [-Password <String>] [-SecurePassword <SecureString>] [-ADUserName <String>] [-ADPassword <SecureString>] [-Force] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Repair-AcctADAccount -ADAccountSid <String[]> [-Password <String>] [-SecurePassword <SecureString>] [-ADUserName <String>] [-ADPassword <SecureString>] [-Force] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## Detailed Description
   This provides the ability to synchronize the account password stored in Active Directory with the password stored in the AD Identity Service.  If successful, this results in the AD Identity Service account state being reset to 'available' so it can be consumed by other Machine Creation Services.

If the current account password is not suplied using the Password or SecurePassword Parameters, this requires the user who initiated the runspace to have the required permissions in Active Directory to reset the Active Directory Account password.

If the current account password is supplied then this command will use the password change operation which does not require any elevated permissions in Active Directory.
