# Set-Acctidentitypool
Update parameters of an identity pool.
## Syntax
```
Set-AcctIdentityPool [-IdentityPoolName] <String> [-NamingScheme <String>] [-NamingSchemeType <ADIdentityNamingScheme>] [-OU <String>] [-Domain <String>] [-AllowUnicode] [-PassThru] [-StartCount <Int32>] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Set-AcctIdentityPool -IdentityPoolUid <Guid> [-NamingScheme <String>] [-NamingSchemeType <ADIdentityNamingScheme>] [-OU <String>] [-Domain <String>] [-AllowUnicode] [-PassThru] [-StartCount <Int32>] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
Provides the ability to modify the parameters of an identity pool.

Note: When changing a naming scheme or naming scheme type, the index is not reset to 0; it continues to avoid AD account name clashes with existing accounts.  If required, use the New-AcctAdAccount command to change the index when creating further accounts.

## Parameters
| Name   | Description | Required? | Pipeline Input | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IdentityPoolName | The name of the identity pool that is to be modified. | true | true (ByPropertyName) |  |
| IdentityPoolUid | The unique identifier for the identity pool that is to be updated. | true | false |  |
| NamingScheme | The new naming scheme that is to be used for the identity pool. | false | false |  |
| NamingSchemeType | The new naming scheme type that is to be used for the identity pool.  This can be Numeric or Alphabetic. | false | false |  |
| OU | The new OU to be used for the Identity Pool.  All accounts created after this is set are created in this AD container.  This will not move any of the existing accounts.  The OU must be a valid AD container and of the domain specified for the pool. | false | false |  |
| Domain | The new Active Directory domain that is to be used for the identity pool.  All new accounts will be created in this domain, but this will not impact any of the existing accounts.  The domain can be specified in either long or short form (i.e. domain or domain.com). | false | false |  |
| AllowUnicode | Updates the definition of the allowed characters in a naming scheme. | false | false |  |
| PassThru | Defines whether the command returns the new state of the identity pool or not. | false | false | false |
| StartCount | The start index for the next create operation | false | false |  |
| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high-level operation this cmdlet call forms a part of. Citrix Studio and Director typically create high-level operations. PowerShell scripts can also wrap a series of cmdlet calls in a high-level operation by way of the Start-LogHighLevelOperation and Stop-LogHighLevelOperation cmdlets. | false | false |  |
| BearerToken | Specifies the bearer token assigned to the calling user | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller that the PowerShell snap-in connects to.  You can provide this as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | LocalHost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value becomes the default. |

## Examples

### Example 1
```
C:\PS>Set-AcctIdentityPool -IdentityPoolName poolName -StartCount 100 -NamingScheme AC####
```
#### Description
Changes the start count, and the naming scheme, so that the next account generated will be AC0100 (assuming that account does not already exist)
