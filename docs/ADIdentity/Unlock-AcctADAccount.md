# Unlock-Acctadaccount
Unlocks AD accounts within the AD Identity Service.
## Syntax
```
Unlock-AcctADAccount -ADAccountName <String> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Unlock-AcctADAccount -ADAccountSid <String> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
Provides the ability to unlock the AD Identity Service identity item that references a specified AD account. An AD account is marked as locked in the AD Identity Service while the Machine Creation Services (MCS) are processing tasks relating to the account.  If these tasks are forcibly stopped, an account can remain locked despite no longer being processed. This command resolves this issue, but use it with caution because unlocking an account that MCS expects to be locked can result in an MCS operation being cancelled. Use this command only when MCS has locked an account for use in a provisioning operation, and where this operation has failed without unlocking the account.

Note: This command does NOT make any changes to the account information stored in Active Directory.
