# Get-AnalyticsServiceInstance

   Gets the service instance entries for the Analytics Service.

## Syntax
```
Get-AnalyticsServiceInstance [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## Detailed Description
   Returns service interfaces published by instances of the Analytics Service. Each instance of a service publishes multiple interfaces with distinct interface types, and each of these interfaces is represented as a ServiceInstance object. Service instances can be used to register the service with a central configuration service so that other services can use the functionality.

You do not need to configure a database connection to use this command.
