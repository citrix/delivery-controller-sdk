# Add-AppLibAppDiskScope

   Add the specified AppDisk(s) to the given scope(s).

## Syntax
```
Add-AppLibAppDiskScope [-Scope] <String[]> -InputObject <AppDisk[]> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Add-AppLibAppDiskScope [-Scope] <String[]> -AppDiskUid <Guid[]> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Add-AppLibAppDiskScope [-Scope] <String[]> -AppDiskName <String[]> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## Detailed Description
   The Add-AppLibAppDiskScope command is used to associate one or more AppDisk objects with given scope(s).

There are multiple parameter sets for this cmdlet, allowing you to identify the AppDisk objects in different ways: 
 - AppDisk objects can be piped in or specified by the InputObject parameter 
 - The AppDiskUid parameter specifies objects by AppDiskUid 
 - The AppDiskName parameter specifies objects by AppDiskName (supports wildcards)

To add a AppDisk to a scope you need permission to change the scopes of the AppDisk and permission to add objects to all of the scopes you have specified.

If the AppDisk is already in a scope, that scope will be silently ignored.

## Parameters

| Name   | Description | Required? | Pipeline Input | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Scope | Specifies the scopes to add the objects to. | true | false |  |
| InputObject | Specifies the AppDisk objects to be added. | true | true (ByValue, ByPropertyName) |  |
| AppDiskUid | Specifies the AppDisk objects to be added by AppDiskUid. | true | true (ByValue, ByPropertyName) |  |
| AppDiskName | Specifies the AppDisk objects to be added by AppDiskName. | true | true (ByValue, ByPropertyName) |  |
| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high-level operation this cmdlet call forms a part of. Citrix Studio and Director typically create high-level operations. PowerShell scripts can also wrap a series of cmdlet calls in a high-level operation by way of the Start-LogHighLevelOperation and Stop-LogHighLevelOperation cmdlets. | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller the PowerShell snap-in will connect to. You can provide this as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | Localhost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value becomes the default. |
