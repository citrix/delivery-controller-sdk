## Parameters

| Name   | Description | Required? | Pipeline Input | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AppDiskName | The name of the AppDisk to delete. | true | false |  |
| AppDiskUid | The Uid of the AppDisk to delete | true | true (ByPropertyName) |  |
| Force | Set this parameter to force the AppDisk to be deleted, by also abandoning any operations currently processing it. | false | false |  |
| RunAsynchronously | Indicates whether or not the command returns before it is complete. If specified, the command returns an identifier for the task that was created. This task can be monitored using the Get-AppLibTask command. | false | false | false |
| PurgeJobOnSuccess | Indicates that the task history is removed from the database when the task has finished. This can only be specified for tasks that are not run asynchronously. | false | false |  |
| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high-level operation this cmdlet call forms a part of. Citrix Studio and Director typically create high-level operations. PowerShell scripts can also wrap a series of cmdlet calls in a high-level operation by way of the Start-LogHighLevelOperation and Stop-LogHighLevelOperation cmdlets. | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller the PowerShell snap-in will connect to. You can provide this as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | Localhost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value becomes the default. |

## Return Values
### System.Guid
   When the RunAsynchronously identifier is specified, this GUID is returned and provides the task identifier### System.Management.Automation.PSCustomObject
