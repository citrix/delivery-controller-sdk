## Detailed Description
The Remove-AppLibAppDiskScope command is used to remove one or more AppDisk objects from the given scope(s).

There are multiple parameter sets for this cmdlet, allowing you to identify the AppDisk objects in different ways: - AppDisk objects can be piped in or specified by the InputObject parameter - The AppDiskUid parameter specifies objects by AppDiskUid - The AppDiskName parameter specifies objects by AppDiskName (supports wildcards)

To remove a AppDisk from a scope you need permission to change the scopes of the AppDisk.

If the AppDisk is not in a specified scope, that scope will be silently ignored.
