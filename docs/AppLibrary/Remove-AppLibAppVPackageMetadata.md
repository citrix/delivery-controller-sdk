## Parameters

| Name   | Description | Required? | Pipeline Input | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AppVPackageUid | Id of the AppVPackage | true | true (ByValue, ByPropertyName) |  |
| AppVPackageName | Name of the AppVPackage | true | true (ByValue, ByPropertyName) |  |
| InputObject | Objects to which the metadata is to be added. | true | true (ByValue) |  |
| Name | The metadata property to remove. | true | false |  |
| Map | Specifies a dictionary of (name, value)-pairs for the properties. This can be either a hashtable (created with @{"name1" = "val1"; "name2" = "val2"}) or a string dictionary (created with new-object "System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary[String,String]"). The properties whose names match keys in the map will be removed. | true | true (ByValue) |  |
| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high-level operation this cmdlet call forms a part of. Citrix Studio and Director typically create high-level operations. PowerShell scripts can also wrap a series of cmdlet calls in a high-level operation by way of the Start-LogHighLevelOperation and Stop-LogHighLevelOperation cmdlets. | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller the PowerShell snap-in will connect to. You can provide this as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | Localhost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value becomes the default. |
