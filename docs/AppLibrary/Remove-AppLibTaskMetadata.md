| TaskId | Id of the Task | true | true (ByValue, ByPropertyName) |  |
| InputObject | Objects to which the metadata is to be added. | true | true (ByValue) |  |
| Name | The metadata property to remove. | true | false |  |

| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high-level operation this cmdlet call forms a part of. Citrix Studio and Director typically create high-level operations.

| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller the PowerShell snap-in will connect to. You can provide this as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | Localhost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value becomes the default. |
