## Parameters
| Name   | Description | Required? | Pipeline Input | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AppDiskName | The name of the AppDisk to analyse | true | false |  |
| AppDiskUid | The unique identifier of the App Disk to analyse | true | true (ByPropertyName) |  |
| RunAsynchronously | Indicates whether or not the command returns before it is complete. If specified, the command returns an identifier for the task that was created. This task can be monitored using the Get-AppLibTask command. | false | false | false |
| PurgeJobOnSuccess | Indicates that the task history is removed from the database when the task has finished. This can only be specified for tasks that are not run asynchronously. | false | false |  |
| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high-level operation this cmdlet call forms a part of. Citrix Studio and Director typically create high-level operations. PowerShell scripts can also wrap a series of cmdlet calls in a high-level operation by way of the Start-LogHighLevelOperation and Stop-LogHighLevelOperation cmdlets. | false | false |  |
| BearerToken | Specifies the bearer token assigned to the calling user | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller the PowerShell snap-in will connect to. You can provide this as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | Localhost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value becomes the default. |

## Notes
Only one long-running task for each AppDisk can be processed at a time.<br>    In case of failure, the following errors can result.<br>    Error Codes<br>    -----------<br>    JobCreationFailed<br>    The requested task could not be started.<br>    DatabaseError<br>    An error occurred in the service while attempting a database operation.<br>    DatabaseNotConfigured<br>    The operation could not be completed because the database for the service is not configured.<br>    ServiceStatusInvalidDb<br>    An error occurred in the service while attempting a database operation. Communication with the database failed for<br>    for various reasons.<br>    CommunicationError<br>    An error occurred while communicating with the service.<br>    InvalidParameterCombination<br>    Both PurgeJobOnSuccess and RunAsynchronously were specified. When running asynchronously, the cmdlet terminates before the job does, so it cannot clean up the completed job.<br>    PermissionDenied<br>    The user does not have administrative rights to perform this operation.<br>    ConfigurationLoggingError<br>    The operation could not be performed because of a configuration logging error.<br>    ScopeNotFound<br>    One or more of the scopes nominated for the imported AppDisk do not exist.<br>    ExceptionThrown<br>    An unexpected error occurred. To locate more details, see the Windows event logs on the controller being used, or examine the XenDesktop logs.
