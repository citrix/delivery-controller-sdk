# Add-BrokerMachine

   Adds one or more machines to a desktop group.

## Syntax
```
Add-BrokerMachine [-InputObject] <Machine[]> [-DesktopGroup <DesktopGroup>] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Add-BrokerMachine [-MachineName] <String> [-DesktopGroup <DesktopGroup>] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## Detailed Description
   The Add-BrokerMachine cmdlet adds specified machines to a desktop group. There are three forms:


o Use the -InputObject parameter to add a single machine instance or array of instances to the group.
o Use the -MachineName parameter to add a single, named machine to the group.
o Use pipelining to pipe machines instances to the command.

The desktop group to which the machines are added can be specified by name, unique identifier (UID), or instance.

For a machine to be used in a site, the machine must be added to a desktop group. The machine and desktop group must be compatible in order for the process to succeed; for example a machine in a single-session catalog cannot be added to a multi-session desktop group.

For more information about machines, see about_Broker_Machines.
