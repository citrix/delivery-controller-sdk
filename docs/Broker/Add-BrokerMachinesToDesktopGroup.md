# Add-Brokermachinestodesktopgroup
Adds machines from a catalog to a desktop group.
## Syntax
```
Add-BrokerMachinesToDesktopGroup [-Catalog] <Catalog> [-DesktopGroup] <DesktopGroup> [-Count] <Int32> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [-BearerToken <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
The Add-BrokerMachinesToDesktopGroup cmdlet adds a specified number of machines from a catalog to a desktop group.

The cmdlet adds as many machines as possible from the catalog to the desktop group, up to the specified number. The number of machines successfully added to the desktop group is returned.

The machines are added randomly from the catalog and are selected from those that are not already members of a desktop group, and not already assigned to a client, IP address, or user.

Both the catalog and desktop group can be referenced either by instance, name, or unique identifier (Uid). The allocation type of the catalog must be compatible with the type of desktop group. This means the session support (single/multi) and the allocation type (private/shared) of the catalog must match the session support and allocation type in the desktop group.
