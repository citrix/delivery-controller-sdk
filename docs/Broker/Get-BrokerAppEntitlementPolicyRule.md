## Detailed Description
Returns application rules matching the specified search criteria from the site's entitlement policy. If no search criteria are specified, all application rules in the entitlement policy are obtained.

An application rule in the entitlement policy defines the users who are allowed per-session access to a machine to run one or more applications published from the rule's desktop group.


### Brokerappentitlementpolicyrule Object
The BrokerAppEntitlementPolicyRule object represents a single application rule within the site's entitlement policy. It contains the following properties:


  * Description (System.String) Optional description of the rule. The text is purely informational for the administrator, it is never visible to the end user.

  * DesktopGroupUid (System.Int32) The unique ID of the desktop group to which the rule applies.

  * Enabled (System.Boolean) Indicates whether the rule is enabled. A disabled rule is ignored when evaluating the site's entitlement policy.

  * ExcludedUserFilterEnabled (System.Boolean) Indicates whether the excluded users filter of the rule is enabled. If the filter is disabled then any user entries in the filter are ignored when entitlement policy rules are evaluated.

  * ExcludedUsers (Citrix.Broker.Admin.SDK.ChbUser\[\]) The excluded users filter of the rule, that is, the users and groups who are explicitly denied entitlements to use published applications from the associated desktop group.

  * IncludedUserFilterEnabled (System.Boolean) Indicates whether the included users filter of the rule is enabled. If the filter is disabled then any user who satisfies the requirements of the access policy is implicitly granted an entitlement to an application session by the rule.

  * IncludedUsers (Citrix.Broker.Admin.SDK.ChbUser\[\]) The included users filter of the rule, that is, the users and groups who are granted an entitlement to an application session by the rule.
    If a user appears explicitly in the excluded users filter of the rule or is a member of a group that appears in the excluded users filter, no entitlement is granted whether or not the user appears in the included users filter.

  * LeasingBehavior (Citrix.Broker.Admin.SDK.LeasingBehavior) Defines the desired connection leasing behavior applied to sessions launched using this entitlement. Possible values are: Allowed and Disallowed.

  * Name (System.String) The administrative name of the rule. Each rule in the site's entitlement policy must have a unique name (irrespective of whether they are desktop or application rules).

  * SessionReconnection (Citrix.Broker.Admin.SDK.SessionReconnection) Defines reconnection (roaming) behavior for sessions launched using this rule. Possible values are: Always, DisconnectedOnly, and SameEndpointOnly.

  * Uid (System.Int32) The unique ID of the rule itself.
