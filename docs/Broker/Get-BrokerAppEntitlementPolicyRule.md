## Detailed Description
   Returns application rules matching the specified search criteria from the site's entitlement policy. If no search criteria are specified, all application rules in the entitlement policy are obtained.

An application rule in the entitlement policy defines the users who are allowed per-session access to a machine to run one or more applications published from the rule's desktop group.


-------------------------- BrokerAppEntitlementPolicyRule Object
The BrokerAppEntitlementPolicyRule object represents a single application rule within the site's entitlement policy. It contains the following properties:

    -- Description (System.String)
       Optional description of the rule. The text is purely informational for the administrator, it is never visible to the end user.

    -- DesktopGroupUid (System.Int32)
       The unique ID of the desktop group to which the rule applies.

    -- Enabled (System.Boolean)
       Indicates whether the rule is enabled. A disabled rule is ignored when evaluating the site's entitlement policy.

    -- ExcludedUserFilterEnabled (System.Boolean)
       Indicates whether the excluded users filter of the rule is enabled. If the filter is disabled then any user entries in the filter are ignored when entitlement policy rules are evaluated.

    -- ExcludedUsers (Citrix.Broker.Admin.SDK.ChbUser[])
       The excluded users filter of the rule, that is, the users and groups who are explicitly denied entitlements to use published applications from the associated desktop group.

    -- IncludedUserFilterEnabled (System.Boolean)
       Indicates whether the included users filter of the rule is enabled. If the filter is disabled then any user who satisfies the requirements of the access policy is implicitly granted an entitlement to an application session by the rule.

    -- IncludedUsers (Citrix.Broker.Admin.SDK.ChbUser[])
       The included users filter of the rule, that is, the users and groups who are granted an entitlement to an application session by the rule.

       If a user appears explicitly in the excluded users filter of the rule or is a member of a group that appears in the excluded users filter, no entitlement is granted whether or not the user appears in the included users filter.

    -- LeasingBehavior (Citrix.Broker.Admin.SDK.LeasingBehavior)
       Defines the desired connection leasing behavior applied to sessions launched using this entitlement. Possible values are:
       Allowed and Disallowed.

    -- Name (System.String)
       The administrative name of the rule. Each rule in the site's entitlement policy must have a unique name (irrespective of whether they are desktop or application rules).

    -- SessionReconnection (Citrix.Broker.Admin.SDK.SessionReconnection)
       Defines reconnection (roaming) behavior for sessions launched using this rule. Possible values are:
       Always, DisconnectedOnly, and SameEndpointOnly.

    -- Uid (System.Int32)
       The unique ID of the rule itself.

| SessionReconnection | Gets only application rules with the specified session reconnection behavior. Possible values are:<br>Always, DisconnectedOnly, and SameEndpointOnly. | false | false |  |
| ReturnTotalRecordCount | When specified, this causes the cmdlet to output an error record containing the number of records available. This error record is additional information and does not affect the objects written to the output pipeline. See about_Broker_Filtering for details. | false | false | False |
| MaxRecordCount | Specifies the maximum number of records to return. | false | false | 250 |
| Skip | Skips the specified number of records before returning results. Also reduces the count returned by -ReturnTotalRecordCount. | false | false | 0 |
| SortBy | Sorts the results by the specified list of properties. The list is a set of property names separated by commas, semi-colons, or spaces. Optionally, prefix each name with a + or - to indicate ascending or descending order. Ascending order is assumed if no prefix is present. | false | false | The default sort order is by name or unique identifier. |
| Filter | Gets records that match a PowerShell style filter expression. See about_Broker_Filtering for details. | false | false |  |
| Property | Specifies the properties to be returned. This is similar to piping the output of the command through Select-Object, but the properties are filtered more efficiently at the server. | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller that the PowerShell snapin will connect to. This can be provided as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | Localhost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value will become the default. |
