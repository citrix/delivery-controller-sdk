## Detailed Description
The Get-BrokerApplication cmdlet gets the published applications that are hosted on this site.

Without parameters, Get-BrokerApplication gets all the applications that have been published, regardless of whether they are visible to users or not. You can also use the parameters of Get-BrokerApplication to filter the results to just the applications you're interested in. You can also identify applications by their UIDs or their BrowserNames.

For more information about applications, see about\_Broker\_Applications.


### Brokerapplication Object
The BrokerApplication object represents a published application in the site. It contains the following properties:


  * AdminFolderName (System.String) The name of the admin folder the application is in (including trailing backslash), or the empty string if the application is at the root level

  * AdminFolderUid (System.Int32) The Uid of the admin folder the application is in (if any)

  * AllAssociatedDesktopGroupUids (System.Int32\[\]) List of associated desktop group uids, including desktop groups that are indirectly associated with the application by virtue of being associated with an application group of which this application is a member.

  * AllAssociatedDesktopGroupUUIDs (System.Guid\[\]) List of associated desktop group UUIDs, including desktop groups that are indirectly associated with the application by virtue of being associated with an application group of which this application is a member.

  * ApplicationName (System.String) The simple name of the application within its parent admin folder (if any)

  * ApplicationType (Citrix.Broker.Admin.SDK.ApplicationType) The type of the application, whether HostedOnDesktop, InstalledOnClient or PublishedContent.

  * AssociatedApplicationGroupUids (System.Int32\[\]) List of associated application group uids.

  * AssociatedApplicationGroupUUIDs (System.Guid\[\]) List of associated application group UUIDs.

  * AssociatedDesktopGroupPriorities (System.Int32\[\]) List of directly associated desktop group priorities. Associated desktop groups is the list of desktop groups on which the application is published. When launching an application an available machine from one of the associated groups is selected. Desktop groups are searched for available machines in order of their priority.

  * AssociatedDesktopGroupUids (System.Int32\[\]) List of directly associated desktop group uids. Associated desktop groups is the list of desktop groups on which the application is published. The list is sorted by priority, with the highest priority group first.

  * AssociatedDesktopGroupUUIDs (System.Guid\[\]) List of directly associated desktop group UUIDs. Associated desktop groups is the list of desktop groups on which the application is published. The list is sorted by priority, with the highest priority group first.

  * AssociatedUserFullNames (System.String\[\]) List of associated users (full names). Associated users is the list of users who are given access using the application/user mapping filter.

  * AssociatedUserNames (System.String\[\]) List of associated users (SAM names). Associated users is the list of users who are given access using the application/user mapping filter.

  * AssociatedUserUPNs (System.String\[\]) List of associated users (user principle names). Associated users is the list of users who are given access using the application/user mapping filter.

  * BrowserName (System.String) Unique browser name used to identify this application to other components in the site. This value is not visible to the end users.

  * ClientFolder (System.String) The folder that the application belongs to as the user sees it.

  * CommandLineArguments (System.String) The command-line arguments to use when launching the executable.

  * CommandLineExecutable (System.String) The name including the full path of the executable file to launch.

  * ConfigurationSlotUids (System.Int32\[\]) Uids of any configuration slots which hold machine configurations associated with the application. The order of slot UIDs in this list correspond with the order of items in the associated MachineConfigurationNames and MachineConfigurationUids list properties, and so the same slot UID can appear more than once.

  * CpuPriorityLevel (Citrix.Broker.Admin.SDK.CpuPriorityLevel) The CPU priority of the launched process. Valid values are: Low, BelowNormal, Normal, AboveNormal, and High.

  * Description (System.String) Optional application description. This description is visible to the end users.

  * Enabled (System.Boolean) Specifies whether or not this application can be launched.

  * HomeZoneName (System.String) Name of optional preferred home zone for launching the application.

  * HomeZoneOnly (System.Boolean) Indicates that if the preferred zone for launching the application is its home zone but no machine is available from that zone then the launch fails.

  * HomeZoneUid (System.Guid?) Optional preferred home zone for launching the application.

  * IconFromClient (System.Boolean) Specifies if the app icon should be retrieved from the application on the client. This is reserved for possible future use, and all applications of type HostedOnDesktop cannot set or change this value.

  * IconUid (System.Int32?) The icon UID used for this application. If not specified a generic icon is used.

  * IgnoreUserHomeZone (System.Boolean) Indicates that when launching the application and the user has a home zone specified then the user's home zone preference should be ignored.

  * MetadataMap (System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;) Metadata for this application.

  * Name (System.String) Unique administrative name of application; this will include any parent admin folder hierarchy separated by backslash characters.

  * PublishedName (System.String) Published name of application as seen by end user. If not specified value used defaults to the administrative name.

  * SecureCmdLineArgumentsEnabled (System.Boolean) Specifies whether the command-line arguments should be secured.
