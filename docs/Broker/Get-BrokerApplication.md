## Detailed Description
   The Get-BrokerApplication cmdlet gets the published applications that are hosted on this site.

Without parameters, Get-BrokerApplication gets all the applications that have been published, regardless of whether they are visible to users or not. You can also use the parameters of Get-BrokerApplication to filter the results to just the applications you're interested in. You can also identify applications by their UIDs or their BrowserNames.

For more information about applications, see about_Broker_Applications.

    -- AllAssociatedDesktopGroupUUIDs (System.Guid[])
       List of associated desktop group UUIDs, including desktop groups that are indirectly associated with the application by virtue of being associated with an application group of which this application is a member.

    -- ApplicationName (System.String)
       The simple name of the application within its parent admin folder (if any)

    -- ApplicationType (Citrix.Broker.Admin.SDK.ApplicationType)

       List of associated application group UUIDs.

    -- AssociatedDesktopGroupPriorities (System.Int32[])
       List of directly associated desktop group priorities. Associated desktop groups is the list of desktop groups on which the application is published. When launching an application an available machine from one of the associated groups is selected. Desktop groups are searched for available machines in order of their priority.

    -- AssociatedDesktopGroupUids (System.Int32[])
       List of directly associated desktop group uids. Associated desktop groups is the list of desktop groups on which the application is published. The list is sorted by priority, with the highest priority group first.

    -- AssociatedDesktopGroupUUIDs (System.Guid[])
       List of directly associated desktop group UUIDs. Associated desktop groups is the list of desktop groups on which the application is published. The list is sorted by priority, with the highest priority group first.

    -- AssociatedUserFullNames (System.String[])
