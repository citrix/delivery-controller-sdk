## Detailed Description
   The Get-BrokerApplicationGroup cmdlet returns application groups that have been configured as part of the site.

With no parameters, Get-BrokerApplicationGroup returns all the application groups that have been configured. You also can use the parameters of Get-BrokerApplicationGroup to filter the results to just application groups you're interested in. You can also identify application groups by their UIDs or their Names.

See about_Broker_Applications for more information.


-------------------------- BrokerApplicationGroup Object
A BrokerApplicationGroup object represents a single application group that has been configured as part of the site. It has the following properties:

    -- AssociatedDesktopGroupPriorities (System.Int32[])
       List of associated desktop group priorities. This list is presented in the same order as AssociatedDesktopGroupUids and AssociatedDesktopGroupUUIDs.

       When launching an application an available machine from one of the associated desktop groups is selected. Desktop groups are searched for available machines in order of their priority.

    -- AssociatedDesktopGroupUids (System.Int32[])
       List of associated desktop group uids. Associated desktop groups is the list of desktop groups on which the application group is published. The list is sorted by priority, with the highest priority desktop group first.

    -- AssociatedDesktopGroupUUIDs (System.Guid[])
       List of associated desktop group UUIDs. Associated desktop groups is the list of desktop groups on which the application group is published. The list is sorted by priority, with the highest priority desktop group first.

    -- AssociatedUserFullNames (System.String[])
       List of associated users (full names). Associated users is the list of users who are given access using the application group/user mapping filter.

    -- AssociatedUserNames (System.String[])
       List of associated users (SAM names). Associated users is the list of users who are given access using the application group/user mapping filter.

    -- AssociatedUserUPNs (System.String[])
       List of associated users (user principle names). Associated users is the list of users who are given access using the application group/user mapping filter.

    -- Description (System.String)
       Optional application group description. This description is visible in Citrix Studio and can be used for any purpose. As with other facets of application groups, the description is not visible to end users.

    -- Enabled (System.Boolean)
       Specifies whether or not the applications in this application group can be launched.

    -- MetadataMap (System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary<string, string>)
       Metadata for this application group.

    -- Name (System.String)
       Name of this application group. The name is visible in Citrix Studio and uniquely identifies the application group. As with other facets of application groups, the name is not visible to end users.

    -- RestrictToTag (System.String)
       Optional tag that may be used further to restrict which machines may be used for launching the application group's applications. A machine may be used by an application group if either the application group has no tag restriction or the application group does have a tag restriction and the machine is tagged with the same tag.

    -- Scopes (Citrix.Broker.Admin.SDK.ScopeReference[])
       The list of the delegated admin scopes to which the application group belongs.

    -- SessionSharingEnabled (System.Boolean)
       Whether applications in this application group can share sessions with applications in other application groups (or with applications that are not a member of an application group).

       Applications in the same application group can always share sessions with each other, unless session sharing has been disabled by other means.

    -- Tags (System.String[])
       Tags associated with the application group.

    -- TenantId (System.Guid?)
       Identity of tenant associated with application group. Not applicable (always blank) in non-multitenant sites.

    -- TotalApplications (System.Int32)
       Number of applications in the application group.

    -- TotalMachines (System.Int32)
       Total number of machines across all desktop groups on which the application group is published.

    -- TotalMachinesWithTagRestriction (System.Int32)
       Total number of machines across all desktop groups on which the application group is published, and which are tagged with the tag given by the RestrictToTag property.

       The value of this property is always equal to or less than the value of the TotalMachines property. If RestrictToTag is $null, then the properties' values are equal.

    -- Uid (System.Int32)
       Uid of the application group.

    -- UserFilterEnabled (System.Boolean)
       Whether the application group's user filter is enabled.

    -- UUID (System.Guid)
       UUID of the application group.

## Parameters

| Name   | Description | Required? | Pipeline Input | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Uid | Gets the application group with the given Uid. | true | false |  |
| Name | Gets application groups whose name matches the supplied pattern. | false | false |  |
| AssociatedDesktopGroupPriority | Gets application groups with which a desktop group has been associated with the specified priority. | false | false |  |
| AssociatedDesktopGroupUid | Gets application groups which have been associated with the specified desktop group. The desktop group is identified by its Uid. | false | false |  |
| AssociatedDesktopGroupUUID | Gets application groups which have been associated with the specified desktop group. The desktop group is identified by its UUID. | false | false |  |
| AssociatedUserFullName | Gets application groups with an associated user identified by their user name (usually 'first-name last-name').<br>If the 'UserFilterEnabled' property is true then access to applications in the application group is restricted to those users only. Otherwise, access is unrestricted (but always subject to other policy rules). | false | false |  |
| AssociatedUserName | Gets application groups with an associated user identified by their user name (in the form 'domain\user').<br>If the 'UserFilterEnabled' property is true then access to applications in the application group is restricted to those users only. Otherwise, access is unrestricted (but always subject to other policy rules). | false | false |  |
| AssociatedUserUPN | Gets application groups with an associated user identified by their user principle name (in the form 'user@domain').<br>If the 'UserFilterEnabled' property is true then access to applications in the application group is restricted to those users only. Otherwise, access is unrestricted (but always subject to other policy rules). | false | false |  |

| SortBy | Sorts the results by the specified list of properties. The list is a set of property names separated by commas, semi-colons, or spaces. Optionally, prefix each name with a + or - to indicate ascending or descending order.

| Filter | Gets records that match a PowerShell style filter expression. See about_Broker_Filtering for details. | false | false |  |
| Property | Specifies the properties to be returned. This is similar to piping the output of the command through Select-Object, but the properties are filtered more efficiently at the server. | false | false |  |
