       Uid of the catalog.

    -- UnassignedCount (System.Int32)
       The number of unassigned machines (machines not assigned to users).

    -- UsedCount (System.Int32)
       The number of machines in the catalog that are in a desktop group.

    -- UUID (System.Guid)
       The global ID of the catalog.
