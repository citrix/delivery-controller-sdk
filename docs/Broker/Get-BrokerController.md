## Detailed Description
   Gets Controllers from the current site that match the specified search criteria.

Controllers are server machines running instances of the broker service. The broker service is responsible for the brokering of user sessions to desktops or applications, and for power management of the underlying machines. An operational site must contain at least one Controller.

If no search criteria are specified, all Controllers in the site are obtained.

| MaxRecordCount | Specifies the maximum number of records to return. | false | false | 250 |
| Skip | Skips the specified number of records before returning results. Also reduces the count returned by -ReturnTotalRecordCount. | false | false | 0 |
| SortBy | Sorts the results by the specified list of properties. The list is a set of property names separated by commas, semi-colons, or spaces. Optionally, prefix each name with a + or - to indicate ascending or descending order.

| Filter | Gets records that match a PowerShell style filter expression. See about_Broker_Filtering for details. | false | false |  |
| Property | Specifies the properties to be returned. This is similar to piping the output of the command through Select-Object, but the properties are filtered more efficiently at the server. | false | false |  |
