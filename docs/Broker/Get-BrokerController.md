## Detailed Description
Gets Controllers from the current site that match the specified search criteria.

Controllers are server machines running instances of the broker service. The broker service is responsible for the brokering of user sessions to desktops or applications, and for power management of the underlying machines. An operational site must contain at least one Controller.

If no search criteria are specified, all Controllers in the site are obtained.

| Filter | Gets records that match a PowerShell style filter expression. See about\_Broker\_Filtering for details. | false | false |  |
| Property | Specifies the properties to be returned. This is similar to piping the output of the command through Select-Object, but the properties are filtered more efficiently at the server. | false | false |  |
