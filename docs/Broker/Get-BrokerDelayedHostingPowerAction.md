| HypervisorConnectionUid | Gets only the records for actions for machines hosted through a hypervisor connection whose ID matches the specified value. | false | false |  |
| ReturnTotalRecordCount | When specified, this causes the cmdlet to output an error record containing the number of records available.

Optionally, prefix each name with a + or - to indicate ascending or descending order.

| Filter | Gets records that match a PowerShell style filter expression. See about\_Broker\_Filtering for details. | false | false |  |
