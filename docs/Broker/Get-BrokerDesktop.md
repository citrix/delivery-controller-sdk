## Detailed Description
This cmdlet is now deprecated, please use Get-BrokerMachine.

Retrieves desktops matching the specified criteria. If no parameters are specified this cmdlet enumerates all desktops.

Get-BrokerDesktop returns objects that combine desktop configuration and state information.

For single-session desktops, session information is displayed if present. It is possible that there are more than one sessions present on single-session desktops if 'fast user switching' is enabled, this cmdlet will prefer to return information about brokered sessions (rather than, for example, unbrokered direct RDP sessions). If there is no session running, session related fields return \$null.

For multi-session desktops, no session information is ever displayed by this cmdlet, so session related fields always return \$null. Get-BrokerSession can be used to get information about sessions on both multi-session and single-session desktops.

To count desktops, rather than retrieve full details of each desktop, use Group-BrokerDesktop instead.

For information about advanced filtering options, see about\_Broker\_Filtering; for information about desktops, see about\_Broker\_Desktops.
