## Detailed Description
Returns desktop rules matching the specified search criteria from the site's entitlement policy. If no search criteria are specified, all desktop rules in the entitlement policy are obtained.

A desktop rule in the entitlement policy defines the users who are allowed per-session access to a machine from the rule's associated desktop group to run a full desktop session.


### Brokerentitlementpolicyrule Object
The BrokerEntitlementPolicyRule object represents a single desktop rule within the site's entitlement policy. It contains the following properties:


  * BrowserName (System.String) Site-wide unique name identifying this desktop entitlement to other components (for example StoreFront).

  * ColorDepth (Citrix.Broker.Admin.SDK.ColorDepth?) The color depth of any desktop session launched by the user from the entitlement. If null, the equivalent setting from the rule's desktop group is used.

  * Description (System.String) Optional description of the rule. The text may be visible to the end user, for example, as a tooltip associated with the desktop entitlement.

  * DesktopGroupUid (System.Int32) The unique ID of the desktop group to which the rule applies.

  * Enabled (System.Boolean) Indicates whether the rule is enabled. A disabled rule is ignored when evaluating the site's entitlement policy.

  * ExcludedUserFilterEnabled (System.Boolean) Indicates whether the excluded users filter is enabled. If the filter is disabled then any user entries in the filter are ignored when entitlement policy rules are evaluated.

  * ExcludedUsers (Citrix.Broker.Admin.SDK.ChbUser\[\]) The excluded users filter of the rule, that is, the users and groups who are explicitly denied an entitlement to a desktop session from this rule.

  * IconUid (System.Int32?) The unique ID of the icon used to display the desktop entitlement to the user. If null, the equivalent setting from the rule's desktop group is used.

  * IncludedUserFilterEnabled (System.Boolean) Indicates whether the included users filter is enabled. If the filter is disabled then any user who satisfies the requirements of the access policy is implicitly granted an entitlement to a desktop session by the rule.

  * IncludedUsers (Citrix.Broker.Admin.SDK.ChbUser\[\]) The included users filter of the rule, that is, the users and groups who are granted an entitlement to a desktop session by the rule.

  * LeasingBehavior (Citrix.Broker.Admin.SDK.LeasingBehavior) Defines the desired connection leasing behavior applied to sessions launched using this entitlement. Possible values are: Allowed and Disallowed.

  * MetadataMap (System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;) A collection of arbitrary key/value pairs that can be associated with the rule. The administrator can use these values for any purpose; they are not used by the site itself in any way.

  * Name (System.String) The administrative name of the rule. Each rule in the site's entitlement policy must have a unique name (irrespective of whether they are desktop or application rules).

  * PublishedName (System.String) The name of the desktop session entitlement as seen by the user. If null, the equivalent setting from the rule's desktop group is used.

  * RestrictToTag (System.String) Optional tag that may be used further to restrict which machines may be made accessible to a user by an entitlement policy rule. A machine may be made accessible by an entitlement policy rule only if either the rule has no tag restriction or the rule does have a tag restriction and the machine is tagged with the same tag.

  * SecureIcaRequired (System.Boolean?) Indicates whether the rule requires the SecureICA protocol for desktop sessions launched using the entitlement. If null, the equivalent setting from the rule's desktop group is used.

  * SessionReconnection (Citrix.Broker.Admin.SDK.SessionReconnection) Defines reconnection (roaming) behavior for sessions launched using this rule. Possible values are: Always, DisconnectedOnly, and SameEndpointOnly.

  * Uid (System.Int32) The unique ID of the rule itself.

  * UUID (System.Guid) UUID of the rule.
