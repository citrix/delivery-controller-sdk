# Get-Brokerinstalleddbversion
Gets a list of all available database schema versions for the Broker Service.
## Syntax
```
Get-BrokerInstalledDbVersion [-Upgrade] [-Downgrade] [-AdminAddress <String>] [-BearerToken <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
Gets the current version number of the Citrix Broker Service database schema when called with no parameters.

When called with the -Upgrade parameter, gets the service schema version numbers to which an upgrade could be performed.

When called with the -Downgrade parameter, gets the service schema version numbers to which a downgrade could be performed.

The SQL scripts to perform schema upgrades and downgrades can be obtained using the Get-BrokerDBVersionChangeScript cmdlet. Citrix recommends that where possible service schema upgrades are performed using Studio rather than manually via the SDK.

Only one of the -Upgrade or -Downgrade parameters may be supplied at once.
