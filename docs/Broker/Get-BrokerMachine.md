## Detailed Description
Retrieves machines matching the specified criteria. If no parameters are specified, this cmdlet enumerates all machines.

Get-BrokerMachine returns objects that combine machine configuration and state information.

For single-session machines, session information is displayed if present. If "fast user switching" is enabled, more than one session may be present on single-session machines. Because this cmdlet returns information only for a single session, if two sessions are present it will return information about the brokered session (rather than, for example, an unbrokered direct RDP session). If there is no session running, session-related fields return \$null.

For multi-session machines, no session information about single sessions is displayed by this cmdlet, and so are always \$null. Get-BrokerSession can be used to get information about sessions on both multi-session and single-session machines.

To count machines, rather than retrieve full details of each machine, use Group-BrokerMachine instead.

See about\_Broker\_Filtering for information about advanced filtering options, and about\_Broker\_Machines for background information about machines.

## Input Type

### None
You cannot pipe input into this cmdlet.
## Return Values

### Citrix.Broker.Admin.Sdk.Machine
Get-BrokerMachine returns an object for each matching desktop.
## Notes
It is generally better to compare dates and times using -Filter and relative comparisons. See about\_Broker\_Filtering and the examples in this topic for more information.
## Examples

### Example 1
```
C:\PS> Get-BrokerMachine -PowerState Suspended

C:\PS> Get-BrokerMachine -Filter { PowerState -eq 'Suspended' }
```
#### Description
These commands return all suspended machines. The second form uses advanced filtering (see about\_Broker\_Filtering).
### Example 2
```
C:\PS> Get-BrokerMachine -DNSName '\*.mydomain.mycompany.com'
```
#### Description
This command returns all machines belonging to the DNS domain mydomain.mycompany.com.
### Example 3
```
C:\PS> Get-BrokerMachine -Filter { RegistrationState -eq 'Registered' -and HypervisorConnectionUid -eq 5 }
```
#### Description
This command returns all registered machines running on the specified hypervisor connection.
### Example 4
```
C:\PS> Get-BrokerMachine -MachineName 'MyDomain\X\*' | Remove-BrokerDesktopGroup 2
```
#### Description
This command finds all of the machines in MyDomain with names beginning with X and removes them from the specified desktop group.
### Example 5
```
C:\PS> Get-BrokerMachine -Filter { DesktopGroupUid -ne $null }
```
#### Description
This command gets all desktops in a site. Use this instead of the deprecated Get-BrokerDesktop command.
