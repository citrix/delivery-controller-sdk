## Detailed Description
Get the list of commands queued for delivery to a desktop.  Commands are batched and can be configured to be delivered at various times during a desktop session's lifetime.  Normally commands are sent within a few minutes of being queued, but it is also possible to queue a command for a user who is not currently logged on or a desktop that is currently switched off.

See about\_Broker\_Filtering for information about advanced filtering options.
