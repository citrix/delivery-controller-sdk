  * HostedMachineId (System.String) Unique ID within the hosting unit of the target managed desktop.

  * HostedMachineName (System.String) The friendly name of a hosted desktop as used by its hypervisor. This is not necessarily the DNS name of the desktop.

  * HostingServerName (System.String) DNS name of the hypervisor that is hosting the desktop if managed.

  * HypervisorConnectionUid (System.Int32?) The UID of the hypervisor connection that the desktop has been assigned to, if managed.

  * IconUid (System.Int32?) The UID of the desktop's icon that is displayed in StoreFront. If this is \$null then the desktop will use the icon specified by the desktop group.

  * InMaintenanceMode (System.Boolean) Denotes whether the desktop is in maintentance mode.

  * IPAddress (System.String) The IP address of the desktop.

  * IsAssigned (System.Boolean) Denotes whether a private desktop has been assigned to a user/users, or a client name/address. Users can be assigned explictitly or by assigning on first use of the desktop.

  * LastDeregistrationReason (Citrix.Broker.Admin.SDK.DeregistrationReason?) The reason for the last deregistration of the desktop with the broker. Possible values are: AgentShutdown, AgentSuspended, AgentRequested, IncompatibleVersion, AgentAddressResolutionFailed, AgentNotContactable, AgentWrongActiveDirectoryOU, EmptyRegistrationRequest, MissingRegistrationCapabilities, MissingAgentVersion, InconsistentRegistrationCapabilities, NotLicensedForFeature, UnsupportedCredentialSecurityVersion, InvalidRegistrationRequest, SingleMultiSessionMismatch, FunctionalLevelTooLowForCatalog, FunctionalLevelTooLowForDesktopGroup, PowerOff, DesktopRestart, DesktopRemoved, AgentRejectedSettingsUpdate, SendSettingsFailure, SessionAuditFailure, SessionPrepareFailure, ContactLost, SettingsCreationFailure, UnknownError and BrokerRegistrationLimitReached.

  * OSType (System.String) A string that can be used to identify the operating system that is running on the desktop.

  * OSVersion (System.String) A string that can be used to identify the version of the operating system running on the desktop, if known.

  * PowerState (Citrix.Broker.Admin.SDK.PowerState) The current power state of the desktop. Possible values are: Unmanaged, Unknown, Unavailable, Off, On, Suspended, TurningOn, TurningOff, Suspending, Resuming.

  * PublishedName (System.String) The name of the desktop that is displayed in StoreFront, if the desktop is published.
