## Detailed Description
   The Get-BrokerRebootScheduleV2 cmdlet is used to enumerate desktop group reboot schedules that match all of the supplied criteria.

A reboot schedule can be configured to cause all of the machines in a desktop group to be rebooted at a particular time each day or each week, with the reboot of the individual machines spread out over the duration of the whole reboot cycle. A specific warning message can be configured to be displayed to users who are running sessions on the machines being rebooted.

See about_Broker_Filtering for information about advanced filtering options.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Uid | Gets the reboot schedule with the specified Uid. | true | false |  |
| Name | Gets the reboot schedule with the specified name. | false | false |  |
| Active | Gets desktop group reboot schedules according to whether they are currently active or not. A schedule is active if there is a reboot cycle currently running that was started as a result of the schedule. | false | false |  |
| Day | Gets the reboot schedules set to run on the specified day (one of Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday). | false | false |  |
| DesktopGroupName | Gets the reboot schedules for the desktop group having this name. | false | false |  |
| DesktopGroupUid | Gets the reboot schedules for the desktop group having this Uid. | false | false |  |
| Enabled | Gets the reboot schedules with the specified Enabled value. | false | false |  |
| Frequency | Gets the reboot schedules with the specified frequency (either Weekly or Daily). | false | false |  |
| MetadataKey | All key names of metadata items associated with this application. | false | false |  |
| Metadata | Gets records with matching metadata entries.<br>The value being compared with is a concatenation of the key name, a colon, and the value. For example: -Metadata "abc:x*" matches records with a metadata entry having a key name of "abc" and a value starting with the letter "x". | false | false |  |
| RebootDuration | Gets the reboot schedules with the specified duration. | false | false |  |
| RestrictToTag | Gets the reboot schedules with the specified tag. | false | false |  |
| StartTime | Gets the reboot schedules with the specified start time (HH:MM). | false | false |  |
| WarningRepeatInterval | Gets the reboot schedules with the specified warning repeat interval. | false | false |  |
| ReturnTotalRecordCount | When specified, this causes the cmdlet to output an error record containing the number of records available. This error record is additional information and does not affect the objects written to the output pipeline. See about_Broker_Filtering for details. | false | false | False |
| MaxRecordCount | Specifies the maximum number of records to return. | false | false | 250 |
| Skip | Skips the specified number of records before returning results. Also reduces the count returned by -ReturnTotalRecordCount. | false | false | 0 |
| SortBy | Sorts the results by the specified list of properties. The list is a set of property names separated by commas, semi-colons, or spaces. Optionally, prefix each name with a + or - to indicate ascending or descending order. Ascending order is assumed if no prefix is present. | false | false | The default sort order is by name or unique identifier. |
| Filter | Gets records that match a PowerShell style filter expression. See about_Broker_Filtering for details. | false | false |  |
| Property | Specifies the properties to be returned. This is similar to piping the output of the command through Select-Object, but the properties are filtered more efficiently at the server. | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller that the PowerShell snapin will connect to. This can be provided as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | Localhost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value will become the default. |
