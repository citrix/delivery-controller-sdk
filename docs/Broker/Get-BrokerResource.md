# Get-Brokerresource
Gets resources that a user can broker connections to.
## Syntax
```
Get-BrokerResource [-User] <String> [-Groups <String[]>] [-TenantId <Guid>] [-ClientName <String>] [-ClientIP <String>] [-ViaAG <Boolean>] [-SmartAccessTags <String[]>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [-BearerToken <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
Retrieve a list of resources that a user has access to, taking into account the site access policy, configuration of desktop groups, assignments, entitlements, and applications.

What a user has access to depends on a number of attributes:

* User's name or security identifier.
* Groups that the user is a member of (names or security identifiers).
* IP address of the client the user connects from.
* Name of the client that the user connects from.
* Whether the user is connecting via Citrix Access Gateway.
* SmartAccess tags when connecting via Citrix Access Gateway.

You must always specify the user's name or security identifier, but you will not always be able to predict what some of the other values will be. By omitting these values the corresponding access checks are ignored.

Consider for example, a site configuration that uses IP address ranges to allow access to private desktop A when connecting from the local network and private desktop B when connecting from home. Running this cmdlet without specifying a client IP address would return both A and B.

The output of this cmdlet depends on the available resources:

* Assigned private desktops are returned as PrivateDesktop objects.
* Shared desktops are returned as EntitlementPolicyRule objects.
* Assign-On-First-Use desktops that have not been assigned yet are returned as AssignmentPolicyRule objects.
* Application resources produce Application objects.

If more than one type of resource is available, the output pipeline contains a mixture of the above objects, in no particular order.

Only resources accessible based on the specified parameters, and visible to the administrator running this cmdlet are returned.
