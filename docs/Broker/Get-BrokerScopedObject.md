# Get-Brokerscopedobject
Gets the details of the scoped objects for the Broker Service.
## Syntax
```
Get-BrokerScopedObject -ScopeId <Guid> [-Property <String[]>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [-BearerToken <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Get-BrokerScopedObject [-Description <String>] [-ObjectId <String>] [-ObjectName <String>] [-ObjectType <ScopedObjectType>] [-ScopeName <String>] [-ReturnTotalRecordCount] [-MaxRecordCount <Int32>] [-Skip <Int32>] [-SortBy <String>] [-Filter <String>] [-Property <String[]>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [-BearerToken <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
Returns a list of directly scoped objects including the names and identifiers of both the scope and object as well as the object description for display purposes.

There will be at least one result for every directly scoped object. When an object is associated with multiple scopes the output contains one result per scope duplicating the object details.

No records are returned for the All scope, though if an object is not in any scope a result with a null ScopeId and ScopeName will be returned.


### Brokerscopedobject Object
A scoped, or scopeable object configured in the Broker.


  * Description (System.String) Description of the object (possibly \$null if the object type does not have a description).

  * ObjectId (System.String) Unique identifier of the object.

  * ObjectName (System.String) Display name of the object.

  * ObjectType (Citrix.Broker.Admin.SDK.ScopedObjectType) Type of the object this entry relates to.

  * ScopeId (System.Guid?) Specifies the unique identifier of the scope.

  * ScopeName (System.String) Specifies the display name of the scope.

## Parameters
| Name   | Description | Required? | Pipeline Input | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ScopeId | Gets scoped object entries for the given scope identifier. | true | false |  |
| Description | Gets scoped object entries for objects with the specified description. | false | false |  |
| ObjectId | Gets scoped object entries for objects with the specified object identifier. | false | false |  |
| ObjectName | Gets scoped object entries for objects with the specified object identifier. | false | false |  |
| ObjectType | Gets scoped object entries for objects of the given type. | false | false |  |
| ScopeName | Gets scoped object entries with the given scope name. | false | false |  |
| ReturnTotalRecordCount | When specified, this causes the cmdlet to output an error record containing the number of records available. This error record is additional information and does not affect the objects written to the output pipeline. See about\_Broker\_Filtering for details. | false | false | False |
| MaxRecordCount | Specifies the maximum number of records to return. | false | false | 250 |
| Skip | Skips the specified number of records before returning results. Also reduces the count returned by -ReturnTotalRecordCount. | false | false | 0 |
| SortBy | Sorts the results by the specified list of properties. The list is a set of property names separated by commas, semi-colons, or spaces. Optionally, prefix each name with a + or - to indicate ascending or descending order. Ascending order is assumed if no prefix is present. | false | false | The default sort order is by name or unique identifier. |
| Filter | Gets records that match a PowerShell style filter expression. See about\_Broker\_Filtering for details. | false | false |  |
| Property | Specifies the properties to be returned. This is similar to piping the output of the command through Select-Object, but the properties are filtered more efficiently at the server. | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller that the PowerShell snapin will connect to. This can be provided as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | Localhost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value will become the default. |
| BearerToken | Specifies the bearer token assigned to the calling user | false | false |  |
