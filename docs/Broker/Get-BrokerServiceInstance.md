# Get-Brokerserviceinstance
Gets the service instance entries for the Broker Service.
## Syntax
```
Get-BrokerServiceInstance [-AdminAddress <String>] [-BearerToken <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
Returns service interfaces published by instances of the Broker Service. Each instance of a service publishes multiple interfaces with distinct interface types, and each of these interfaces is represented as a ServiceInstance object. Service instances can be used to register the service with a central configuration service so that other services can use the functionality.

You do not need to configure a database connection to use this command.
