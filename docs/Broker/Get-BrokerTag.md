| Metadata | Gets records with matching metadata entries.<br>The value being compared with is a concatenation of the key name, a colon, and the value.

| ReturnTotalRecordCount | When specified, this causes the cmdlet to output an error record containing the number of records available.

Optionally, prefix each name with a + or - to indicate ascending or descending order.

| Filter | Gets records that match a PowerShell style filter expression. See about\_Broker\_Filtering for details. | false | false |  |
| Property | Specifies the properties to be returned. This is similar to piping the output of the command through Select-Object, but the properties are filtered more efficiently at the server. | false | false |  |
