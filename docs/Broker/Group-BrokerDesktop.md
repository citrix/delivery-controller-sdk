## Detailed Description
This cmdlet is now deprecated, please use Group-BrokerMachine.

Filters desktops using the specified criteria, then groups and counts matching desktops with the same value for a particular property. The number of desktops in the group, and the property value for the group, is output. For example:


```
C:\PS> Group-BrokerDesktop -Property SummaryState  

```
Count Name ----- ---- 43 Available 17 InUse 3 Disconnected

Filtering supports the same options as the Get-BrokerDesktop cmdlet, and allows filtering on both desktop and session properties.

Group-BrokerDesktop is similar to the standard PowerShell Group-Object, but is faster than piping the output of Get-BrokerDesktop into Group-Object when working with many desktops.

Note that all session information properties for multi-session desktops is always \$null, this means that is is not possible to group these desktops by session information using this command. Use Get-BrokerSession to get information on all current sessions.

Also note that the MaxRecordCount, ReturnTotalRecordCount, Skip, and SortBy parameters apply to GroupInfo records output rather than the filtered desktops.

## Return Values

### Citrix.Broker.Admin.Sdk.Groupinfo
Each GroupInfo object represents one group, and contains the following properties:<br>-- Count: The count of desktops in this group.<br>-- Name: The value of the property the desktops were grouped by (as a string).<br>If you do not specify -SortBy, groups are sorted with the largest count first.
## Notes
