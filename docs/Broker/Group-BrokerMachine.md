```
## Detailed Description
Filters machines using the specified criteria, then groups and counts matching machines with the same value for a particular property. The number of machines in the group, and the property value for the group, is output. For example:


```
C:\PS> Group-BrokerMachine -Property SummaryState  

```
Count Name ----- ---- 43 Available 17 InUse 3 Disconnected

Filtering supports the same options as the Get-BrokerMachine cmdlet, and allows filtering on both machine and session properties.

Group-BrokerMachine is similar to the standard PowerShell Group-Object, but is faster than piping the output of Get-BrokerMachine into Group-Object when working with many machines.

Note that the MaxRecordCount, ReturnTotalRecordCount, Skip, and SortBy parameters apply to GroupInfo records output rather than the filtered machines.

## Input Type

### None
You cannot pipe input into this cmdlet.
## Return Values

### Citrix.Broker.Admin.Sdk.Groupinfo
Each GroupInfo object represents one group, and contains the following properties:<br>-- Count: The count of machines in this group.<br>-- Name: The value of the property the machines were grouped by (as a string).<br>If you do not specify -SortBy, groups are sorted with the largest count first.
## Notes
To compare dates or times, use -Filter and relative comparisons. For more information, see about\_Broker\_Filtering and the examples.
