```

## Detailed Description
   Filters sessions using the specified criteria, then groups and counts matching sessions with the same value for a particular property. The number of sessions in the group, and the property value for the group, is output. For example:

C:\PS> Group-BrokerSession -Property SessionState 

Count Name 
----- ---- 
   43 Active 
   17 NonBrokeredSession 
    3 Disconnected

Filtering supports the same options as the Get-BrokerSession cmdlet, and allows filtering on both machine and session properties.

Group-BrokerSession is similar to the standard PowerShell Group-Object, but is faster than piping the output of Get-BrokerSession into Group-Object when working with many machines.

Note that the MaxRecordCount, ReturnTotalRecordCount, Skip, and SortBy parameters apply to GroupInfo records output rather than the filtered sessions.
