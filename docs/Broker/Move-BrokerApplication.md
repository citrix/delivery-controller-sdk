# Move-BrokerApplication

   Move a published application from one admin folder to another

## Syntax
```
Move-BrokerApplication [-InputObject] <Application[]> [-Destination] <AdminFolder> [-NewName <String>] [-PassThru] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Move-BrokerApplication [-Name] <String> [-Destination] <AdminFolder> [-NewName <String>] [-PassThru] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## Detailed Description
   The Move-BrokerApplication cmdlet moves a published application from one place to another in the tree of admin folders, optionally renaming it in the process (if you only want to change the name of the application for administrative purposes and not its location in the tree, use the Rename-BrokerApplication cmdlet).

The location and name of a published application in this sense is only of interest to the administrator, changes do not affect the end-user experience.
