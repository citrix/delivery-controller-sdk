## Detailed Description
The New-BrokerApplication cmdlet creates a new published application in the site.

New-BrokerApplication creates the application object, and associates it with a desktop group or application group. Application objects have three names that identify them (in addition to their Uid): the Name, BrowserName and the PublishedName. The BrowserName is unique across the entire site, and is primarily used internally. The Name is also unique and is what is seen by the administrator; it contains any prefix for an enclosing admin folder (if any). The PublishedName is not unique and is what is seen by the users.

You can create HostedOnDesktop, InstalledOnClient or PublishedContent applications but the ApplicationType cannot be changed later.

The following special characters are not allowed in the Name, BrowserName or the PublishedName properties: \\ / ; : # . \* ? = &lt; &gt; | \[ \] ( ) " '

In addition the \` character is not allowed in the Name property.

See about\_Broker\_Applications for more information.

## Input Type

### Depends On Parameter
Parameters can be piped by property name.
## Return Values

### Citrix.Broker.Admin.Sdk.Application
New-BrokerApplication returns an Application object.
## Notes
Usually only the Name is specified with the New-BrokerApplication cmdlet, and the system chooses a BrowserName and PublishedName for you. By default the BrowserName is the same as the Name, if it is unique in the site. If not, then "-x" is appended to the name, where "x" is a number. For instance, if there is already an application with a BrowserName of "Notepad" and a new application is created with a Name of "Notepad", then the new application gets a BrowserName of "Notepad-1". If another "Notepad" is published, it has a BrowserName of "Notepad-2".<br>    That said, the BrowserName can optionally be specified as well.
## Examples

### Example 1
```
C:\PS> New-BrokerApplication -ApplicationType HostedOnDesktop -Name "Notepad" -CommandLineExecutable "notepad.exe" -DesktopGroup PrivateDG1
```
#### Description
Creates and returns an object for a published application called "Notepad" that launches "notepad.exe".
### Example 2
```
C:\PS> New-BrokerApplication -ApplicationType PublishedContent -Name "Citrix.com" -CommandLineExecutable "https://www.citrix.com/" -DesktopGroup SharedDG1
```
#### Description
Creates and returns an object for a published application called "Citrix.com" that launches the URL https://www.citrix.com/.
### Example 3
```
C:\PS> $dg = Get-BrokerDesktopGroup "SharedDG1"

C:\PS> $app = New-BrokerApplication -ApplicationType HostedOnDesktop -Name "Notepad" -CommandLineExecutable "notepad.exe" -DesktopGroup $dg

C:\PS> $group = Get-BrokerDesktopGroup -Name "Shared desktop group"

C:\PS> Add-BrokerApplication $app -DesktopGroup $group

C:\PS> $fta = Get-BrokerImportedFTA -ExtensionName ".txt"

C:\PS> New-BrokerConfiguredFTA -ImportedFTA $fta -ApplicationUid $app.Uid
```
#### Description
This is a much more complete example. It creates an application object to publish Notepad and associates it first with the "SharedDG1" desktop group.&lt;br&gt;Next it adds an additional desktop group (one that can host applications), and publishes the application to that desktop group. It then gets the ImportedFTA object for the .txt file-type extension (this assumes file-type associations have already been imported), and then configures it so that ".txt" is associated with the published application.&lt;br&gt;Note: The appropriate access policy and app assignment/entitlement rules must also be configured to allow access to the application.
