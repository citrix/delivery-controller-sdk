# New-BrokerHostingPowerAction

   Creates a new action in the power action queue.

## Syntax
```
New-BrokerHostingPowerAction [-MachineName] <String> -Action <PowerManagementAction> [-ActualPriority <Int32>] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## Detailed Description
   The New-BrokerHostingPowerAction cmdlet adds a new power action record into the queue of power actions to be performed. The power actions in the queue are processed on a priority basis and sent to the relevant hypervisor to change the power state of a virtual machine.

A power action record defines the action to be performed, the machine on which the action is to be performed, and an initial priority value for the action. Multiple actions may be created that relate to the same machine.

For a detailed description of the queuing mechanism, see 'help about_Broker_PowerManagement'.

| ActualPriority | Specifies an initial priority value for the action in the queue.<br>This priority is the current action priority; the 'base' priority for actions created via this cmdlet is always 30.

| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high level operation that this cmdlet call forms a part of. Desktop Studio and Desktop Director typically create High Level Operations.
