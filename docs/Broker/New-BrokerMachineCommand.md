## Detailed Description
   Create a new command queued for delivery to a desktop.  Commands are sent to a specific handler installed on the desktop using the Category parameter. Each handler has its own list of commands identified by the CommandName parameter.  Optional command data can be provided using the CommandData parameter in a format specified by the handler.

Commands are targeted at a specific user, session or machine. Commands targeted at a user can be further be restricted to one or more desktop groups.

The SendTrigger is used to restrict the command to a specific event related to the target. For example, when the target machine registers or when the target user reconnects to a session. The command will be sent to the machine when the SendTrigger occurs for the target.

If the Synchronous switch is provided, the target must be a machine and no SendTrigger can be specified. The command is sent immediately to the machine if it is currently registered and fails if the machine is not registered.

Note that the combined length of the Category and CommandName is limited to 64 characters. The Category and CommandName must both be entirely alphanumeric and not include any white space.
