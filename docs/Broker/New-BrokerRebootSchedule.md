## Parameters

| Name   | Description | Required? | Pipeline Input | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DesktopGroupName | The name of the desktop group that this reboot schedule is applied to. | true | true (ByPropertyName) |  |
| RebootDuration | Approximate maximum number of minutes over which the scheduled reboot cycle runs. | true | true (ByPropertyName) |  |
| DesktopGroupUid | The Uid of the desktop group that this reboot schedule is applied to. | true | true (ByPropertyName) |  |
| Day | For weekly schedules, the day of the week on which the scheduled reboot-cycle starts (one of Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday). | false | true (ByPropertyName) |  |
| Enabled | Boolean that indicates if the new reboot schedule is enabled. | false | true (ByPropertyName) |  |
| Frequency | Frequency with which this schedule runs (either Weekly or Daily). | false | true (ByPropertyName) |  |
| StartTime | Time of day at which the scheduled reboot cycle starts (HH:MM). | false | true (ByPropertyName) |  |
| WarningDuration | Time prior to the initiation of a machine reboot at which warning message is displayed in all user sessions on that machine. If the warning duration is zero then no message is displayed. In some cases the time required to process a reboot schedule may exceed the RebootDuration time by up to the WarningDuration value; Citrix recommends that the WarningDuration is kept small relative to the RebootDuration value. | false | true (ByPropertyName) |  |
| WarningMessage | Warning message displayed in user sessions on a machine scheduled for reboot. If the message is blank then no message is displayed. The optional pattern '%m%' is replaced by the number of minutes until the reboot. | false | true (ByPropertyName) |  |
| WarningRepeatInterval | Time to wait after the previous reboot warning before displaying the warning message in all user sessions on that machine again. If the warning repeat interval is zero then the warning message is not displayed after the initial warning. | false | true (ByPropertyName) |  |
| WarningTitle | The window title used when showing the warning message in user sessions on a machine scheduled for reboot. | false | true (ByPropertyName) |  |
| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high level operation that this cmdlet call forms a part of. Desktop Studio and Desktop Director typically create High Level Operations. PowerShell scripts can also wrap a series of cmdlet calls in a High Level Operation by way of the Start-LogHighLevelOperation and Stop-LogHighLevelOperation cmdlets. | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller that the PowerShell snapin will connect to. This can be provided as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | Localhost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value will become the default. |
