## Detailed Description
   The New-BrokerUser cmdlet creates a new broker object to represent a user identity (or the identity of a group of users). The object is created local to the PowerShell environment in which the cmdlet is run; no new user object is created in the broker configuration, unless the object is added to another broker object, such as a machine or a desktop. For details, see Add-BrokerUser.

The identity of the user or group must be specified using either the Name or SID parameter
