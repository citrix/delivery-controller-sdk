# Remove-Brokeraccesspolicyrule
Deletes a rule from the site's access policy.
## Syntax
```
Remove-BrokerAccessPolicyRule [-InputObject] <AccessPolicyRule[]> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [-BearerToken <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Remove-BrokerAccessPolicyRule [-Name] <String> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [-BearerToken <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
The Remove-BrokerAccessPolicyRule cmdlet deletes a rule from the site's access policy.

An access policy rule defines a set of connection filters and access control rights relating to a desktop group. These allow fine-grained control of what access is granted to a desktop group based on details of, for example, a user's endpoint device, its address, and the user's identity.

Deleting a rule does not affect existing user sessions, but it may result in users being unable to launch new sessions, or reconnect to disconnected sessions if access to the desktop group delivering those sessions was granted by the deleted rule.
