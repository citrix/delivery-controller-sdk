Deletes an application rule from the site's assignment policy.
## Syntax
```
Remove-BrokerAppAssignmentPolicyRule [-InputObject] <AppAssignmentPolicyRule[]> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [-BearerToken <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

```
## Detailed Description
The Remove-BrokerAppAssignmentPolicyRule cmdlet deletes an application rule from the site's assignment policy.

An application rule in the assignment policy defines the users who are entitled to a self-service persistent machine assignment from the rule's desktop group; once assigned the machine can run one or more applications published from the group.

Deleting an application rule does not remove machine assignments that have already been made by the rule, nor does it affect active sessions to those machines in any way.
