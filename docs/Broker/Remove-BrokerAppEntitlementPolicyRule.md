## Detailed Description
The Remove-BrokerAppEntitlementPolicyRule cmdlet deletes an application rule from the site's entitlement policy.

An application rule in the entitlement policy defines the users who are allowed per-session access to a machine to run one or more applications published from the rule's desktop group.

Deleting a rule does not affect existing sessions launched using the rule, but users cannot reconnect to those sessions if they are subsequently disconnected.
