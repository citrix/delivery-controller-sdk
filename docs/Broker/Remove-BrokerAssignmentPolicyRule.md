# Remove-Brokerassignmentpolicyrule
Deletes a desktop rule from the site's assignment policy.
## Syntax
```
Remove-BrokerAssignmentPolicyRule [-InputObject] <AssignmentPolicyRule[]> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [-BearerToken <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Remove-BrokerAssignmentPolicyRule [-Name] <String> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [-BearerToken <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
The Remove-BrokerAssignmentPolicyRule cmdlet deletes a desktop rule from the site's assignment policy.

A desktop rule in the assignment policy defines the users who are entitled to self-service persistent machine assignments from the rule's desktop group. A rule defines how many machines a user is allowed from the group for delivery of full desktop sessions.

Deleting a desktop rule does not remove machine assignments that have already been made by the rule, nor does it affect active sessions to those machines in any way.
