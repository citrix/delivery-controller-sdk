## Detailed Description
The Remove-BrokerEntitlementPolicyRule cmdlet deletes a desktop rule from the site's entitlement policy.

A desktop rule in the entitlement policy defines the users who are allowed per-session access to a machine from the rule's associated desktop group to run a full desktop session.

Deleting a rule does not affect existing sessions launched using the rule, but users cannot reconnect to those sessions if they are subsequently disconnected.
