# Remove-Brokerimportedfta
Deletes one or more imported file type associations.
## Syntax
```
Remove-BrokerImportedFTA -DesktopGroupUids <Int32[]> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [-BearerToken <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
Deletes all of the imported file type associations belonging to one or more desktop groups. At least one desktop group must be specified.

Imported file type associations are grouped together based on the desktop group of the machine from which they were imported. All file types for a desktop group are deleted. There is no mechanism for deleting a subset imported file type associations for a specific desktop group.

Imported file type associations are different from configured file type associations. Imported file type associations are lists of known file type associations for a given desktop group. Configured file type associations are those that are actually associated with published applications for the purposes of content redirection.
