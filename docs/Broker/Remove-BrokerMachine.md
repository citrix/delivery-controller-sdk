# Remove-BrokerMachine

   Removes one or more machines from its desktop group or catalog.

## Syntax
```
Remove-BrokerMachine [-InputObject] <Machine[]> [-Force] [-DesktopGroup <DesktopGroup>] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Remove-BrokerMachine [-MachineName] <String> [-Force] [-DesktopGroup <DesktopGroup>] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## Detailed Description
   The Remove-BrokerMachine cmdlet removes one or more machines from their desktop group or catalog. There are three forms:

o Use the -InputObject parameter to remove a single machine instance or array of instances from their desktop group or catalog.
o Use the -MachineName parameter to remove the single named machine from its group or catalog.
o Use pipelining to pipe machine instances to the command.

To remove machines from their desktop group use the -DesktopGroup parameter; the specified group must be the one that contains the machines. If more than one machine is being removed from its group they must all be members of the same group.

If the -DesktopGroup parameter is not used then the machines are removed from their catalog. Removing a machine from its catalog deletes the record of the machine from the Citrix Broker Service.

Machines cannot be removed from their catalog while they are members of a desktop group.

| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high level operation that this cmdlet call forms a part of. Desktop Studio and Desktop Director typically create High Level Operations.

| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller that the PowerShell snapin will connect to. This can be provided as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | Localhost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value will become the default. |
