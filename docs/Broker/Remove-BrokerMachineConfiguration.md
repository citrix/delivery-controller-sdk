# Remove-Brokermachineconfiguration
Deletes a machine configuration from the site or removes the association from a desktop group.
## Syntax
```
Remove-BrokerMachineConfiguration [-InputObject] <MachineConfiguration[]> [-Application <Application>] [-DesktopGroup <DesktopGroup>] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [-BearerToken <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Remove-BrokerMachineConfiguration [-Name] <String> [-Application <Application>] [-DesktopGroup <DesktopGroup>] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [-BearerToken <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
This cmdlet has three functions:

* Break associations between desktop groups and machine configurations.
* Break associations between applications and machine configurations.
* Remove machine configurations from the system.

If no desktop group or application is specified, then the Remove-MachineConfiguration cmdlet removes the machine configuration from the site.

If a desktop group is specified, then the Remove-MachineConfiguration cmdlet removes the association between the machine configuration and that desktop group. In this case, the machine configuration is not removed from the site.

If an application is specified, then the Remove-MachineConfiguration cmdlet removes the association between the machine configuration and that application. Again, in this case, the machine configuration is not removed from the site.
