# Remove-Brokerpowertimescheme
Deletes an existing power time scheme.
## Syntax
```
Remove-BrokerPowerTimeScheme [-InputObject] <PowerTimeScheme[]> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [-BearerToken <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Remove-BrokerPowerTimeScheme [-Name] <String> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [-BearerToken <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
The Remove-BrokerPowerTimeScheme cmdlet deletes a power time scheme from the system, and leaves the days that the time scheme used to cover for the associated desktop group as defaulting to all hours off-peak and all hours with pool size of -1.

Each power time scheme is associated with a particular desktop group, and covers one or more days of the week, defining which hours of those days are considered peak times and which are off-peak times. In addition, the time scheme defines a pool size value for each hour of the day for the days of the week covered by the time scheme. No one desktop group can be associated with two or more time schemes that cover the same day of the week.

For more information about the power policy mechanism and pool size management, see 'help about\_Broker\_PowerManagement'.
