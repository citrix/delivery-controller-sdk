## Detailed Description
The Rename-BrokerAccessPolicyRule cmdlet renames a rule in the site's access policy. The Name property of the rule is changed.

An access policy rule defines a set of connection filters and access control rights relating to a desktop group. These allow fine-grained control of what access is granted to a desktop group based on details of, for example, a user's endpoint device, its address, and the user's identity.
