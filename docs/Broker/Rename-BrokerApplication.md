# Rename-Brokerapplication
Renames an application.
## Syntax
```
Rename-BrokerApplication [-InputObject] <Application[]> [-NewName] <String> [-PassThru] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [-BearerToken <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Rename-BrokerApplication [-Name] <String> [-NewName] <String> [-PassThru] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [-BearerToken <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
The Rename-BrokerApplication cmdlet changes the administrative name of an application. An application cannot have the same name as another application.

Renaming an application does not alter its published name. To change the name with which this application appears to end-users, set a new value for the PublishedName property using the Set-BrokerApplication cmdlet.

Renaming an application does not alter its BrowserName. If the BrowserName property also needs to be changed, use the Set-BrokerApplication cmdlet to modify it.
