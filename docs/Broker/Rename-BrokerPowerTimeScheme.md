# Rename-Brokerpowertimescheme
Changes the name of an existing power time scheme.
## Syntax
```
Rename-BrokerPowerTimeScheme [-InputObject] <PowerTimeScheme[]> [-NewName] <String> [-PassThru] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [-BearerToken <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Rename-BrokerPowerTimeScheme [-Name] <String> [-NewName] <String> [-PassThru] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [-BearerToken <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
The Rename-BrokerPowerTimeScheme cmdlet renames a particular power time scheme.

Each power time scheme is associated with a particular desktop group, and covers one or more days of the week, defining which hours of those days are considered peak times and which are off-peak times. In addition, the time scheme defines a pool size value for each hour of the day for the days of the week covered by the time scheme. No one desktop group can be associated with two or more time schemes that cover the same day of the week.

For more information about the power policy mechanism and pool size management, see 'help about\_Broker\_PowerManagement'.
