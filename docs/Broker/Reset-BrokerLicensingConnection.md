# Reset-Brokerlicensingconnection
Resets the broker's license server connection.
## Syntax
```
Reset-BrokerLicensingConnection [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [-BearerToken <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
The Reset-BrokerLicensingConnection cmdlet resets the broker's connection to the license server.

Licensing changes resulting from new license files or alterations to the site-level licensing properties don't become effective immediately. There will typically be a delay as the changes are propagated across the site based on the scheduling of refresh logic built into the controllers and the license server.

Resetting the connection causes the list of available licenses for the connection to be updated. After adding licenses or changing the site-level licensing properties you can run Reset-BrokerLicensingConnection to ensure that the broker can access the new licenses immediately.

Each broker service instance holds its own connection to the license server. In order for the licensing changes to be applied immediately throughout the XenDesktop site this command needs to be run on every controller in the site.
