## Detailed Description
The Set-BrokerApplicationGroup cmdlet changes the properties of one or more application groups. The changed properties and the new values of those properties are specified as parameters to Set-BrokerApplicationGroup.

This cmdlet cannot change the relationships of application group objects with other objects. For instance, it cannot change which users can access applications in this application group, or change which desktop groups this application group is published to. To do this, you need to remove the existing association, and then add a new association.

The following example shows how to change the desktop group that application group \$applicationGroup is associated with from \$desktopGroup1 to \$desktopGroup2: Remove-BrokerApplicationGroup \$applicationGroup -DesktopGroup \$desktopGroup1 Add-RemoveApplicationGroup \$applicationGroup -DesktopGroup \$desktopGroup2

Application groups may not be renamed using this cmdlet. To rename an application group, use Rename-BrokerApplicationGroup.
