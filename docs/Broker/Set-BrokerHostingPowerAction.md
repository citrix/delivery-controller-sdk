## Parameters

| Name   | Description | Required? | Pipeline Input | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| InputObject | The power action whose priority is to be changed. | true | true (ByValue) |  |
| MachineName | Changes the priority of actions that are for machines whose name (of the form domain\machine) matches the specified string. | true | true (ByPropertyName) |  |
| PassThru | This cmdlet does not generate any output, unless you use the PassThru parameter, in which case it returns the affected record. | false | false | False |
| ActualPriority | Specifies a new priority value for the action in the queue.<br>This priority is the current action priority; the 'base' or original priority for actions cannot be altered. Numerically lower priority values indicate more important actions that are processed in preference to actions with numerically higher priority settings. | false | false |  |
| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high level operation that this cmdlet call forms a part of. Desktop Studio and Desktop Director typically create High Level Operations. PowerShell scripts can also wrap a series of cmdlet calls in a High Level Operation by way of the Start-LogHighLevelOperation and Stop-LogHighLevelOperation cmdlets. | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller that the PowerShell snapin will connect to. This can be provided as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | Localhost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value will become the default. |
