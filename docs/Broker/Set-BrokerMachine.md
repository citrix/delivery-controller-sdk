## Parameters
| Name   | Description | Required? | Pipeline Input | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| InputObject | The machine instances whose properties you want to set. | true | true (ByValue) |  |
| MachineName | The machine whose properties you want to set. | true | true (ByPropertyName) |  |
| PassThru | This cmdlet does not generate any output, unless you use the PassThru parameter, in which case it returns the affected record. | false | false | False |
| AssignedClientName | Changes the client name assignment of the machine. Set this to \$null to remove the assignment. You can assign machines to multiple users, a single client IP address, or a single client name, but only to one of these categories at a time. | false | false |  |
| AssignedIPAddress | Changes the client IP address assignment of the machine. Set this to \$null to remove the assignment. You can assign machines to multiple users, a single client IP address, or a single client name, but only to one of these categories at a time. | false | false |  |
| HostedMachineId | The unique ID by which the hypervisor recognizes the machine. This may only be set for VMs which are not provisioned by MCS. | false | false |  |
| HypervisorConnectionUid | The hypervisor connection that runs the machine. This may only be set for VMs which are not provisioned by MCS. | false | false |  |
| InMaintenanceMode | Sets whether the machine is in maintenance mode or not. A machine in maintenance mode is not available for new sessions, and for managed machines all automatic power management is disabled. | false | false |  |
| IsReserved | Specifies whether the machine should be reserved for special use, for example, for AppDisk preparation. A machine cannot be reserved if it is already a member of a desktop group. | false | false |  |
| PublishedName | The name of the machine that is displayed in StoreFront, if the machine has been published. It can be set only for private desktops. | false | false |  |
| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high level operation that this cmdlet call forms a part of. Desktop Studio and Desktop Director typically create High Level Operations. PowerShell scripts can also wrap a series of cmdlet calls in a High Level Operation by way of the Start-LogHighLevelOperation and Stop-LogHighLevelOperation cmdlets. | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller that the PowerShell snapin will connect to. This can be provided as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | Localhost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value will become the default. |
| BearerToken | Specifies the bearer token assigned to the calling user | false | false |  |

## Input Type

### Citrix.Broker.Admin.Sdk.Machine
You can pipe in the machines whose properties you want to set.
## Return Values

### None Or Citrix.Broker.Admin.Sdk.Machine
