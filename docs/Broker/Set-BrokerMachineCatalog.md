# Set-Brokermachinecatalog
Moves one or more machines into a different catalog.
## Syntax
```
Set-BrokerMachineCatalog [-InputObject] <Machine[]> [-CatalogUid] <Int32> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [-BearerToken <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
The Set-BrokerMachineCatalog cmdlet is used to move machines into a different catalog. The following properties of the destination catalog must exactly match those of the machine's current catalog otherwise the command fails:


* AllocationType
* ProvisioningType
* PersistUserChanges
* SessionSupport
* IsRemotePC
* MinimumFunctionalLevel
* PhysicalMachines

Changing a machine's catalog does not change the machine's desktop group membership. There is no effect on user sessions present on a machine if its catalog is changed.
