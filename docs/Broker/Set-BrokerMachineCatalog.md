# Set-BrokerMachineCatalog

   Moves one or more machines into a different catalog.

## Syntax
```
Set-BrokerMachineCatalog [-InputObject] <Machine[]> [-CatalogUid] <Int32> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## Detailed Description
   The Set-BrokerMachineCatalog cmdlet is used to move machines into a different catalog. The following properties of the destination catalog must exactly match those of the machine's current catalog otherwise the command fails:

o AllocationType
o ProvisioningType
o PersistUserChanges
o SessionSupport
o IsRemotePC
o MinimumFunctionalLevel
o PhysicalMachines

Changing a machine's catalog does not change the machine's desktop group membership. There is no effect on user sessions present on a machine if its catalog is changed.
