# Set-Brokermachinemaintenancemode
Sets whether the specified machine(s) are in maintenance mode.
## Syntax
```
Set-BrokerMachineMaintenanceMode [-InputObject] <Machine[]> [-MaintenanceMode] <Boolean> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [-BearerToken <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
The cmdlet can be used to set whether a machine is in maintenance mode or not. A machine in maintenance mode is not available for new sessions, and for managed machines all automatic power management is disabled.

There are times when it is necessary to disable desktops. You can do this by setting the InMaintenanceMode property of a desktop to \$true. This puts it into maintenance mode. The broker excludes single-session desktops in maintenance mode from brokering decisions and does not start new sessions on them. Existing sessions are unaffected. For multi-session desktops in maintenance mode, reconnections to existing sessions are allowed, but no new sessions are created on the machine.

Desktops in maintenance mode are also excluded from automatic power management, although explicit power actions are still performed.

This cmdlet is equivalent to using the Set-BrokerMachine cmdlet to set the value of only the InMaintenanceMode property.
