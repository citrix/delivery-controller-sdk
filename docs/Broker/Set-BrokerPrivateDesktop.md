Set-BrokerPrivateDesktop [-InputObject] <PrivateDesktop[]> [-PassThru] [-AssignedClientName <String>] [-AssignedIPAddress <String>] [-ColorDepth <ColorDepth>] [-Description <String>] [-IconUid <Int32>] [-InMaintenanceMode <Boolean>] [-PublishedName <String>] [-SecureIcaRequired <Boolean>] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Set-BrokerPrivateDesktop [-MachineName] <String> [-PassThru] [-AssignedClientName <String>] [-AssignedIPAddress <String>] [-ColorDepth <ColorDepth>] [-Description <String>] [-IconUid <Int32>] [-InMaintenanceMode <Boolean>] [-PublishedName <String>] [-SecureIcaRequired <Boolean>] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

## Detailed Description
   Private desktops are automatically created when a machine is added to a desktop group with a DesktopKind of 'Private', and these inherit default properties. Use Set-BrokerPrivateDesktop to change the configuration settings of an existing private desktop.

To specify private desktops, you can choose whether to update by machine name, or by passing a PrivateDesktop or an array of PrivateDesktop objects. You can also use the Uid or an array of Uids instead.

You cannot modify many properties of a private desktop as these contain status information; for example DNSName, RegistrationState, and OSVersion.

Use Add- and Remove- cmdlets to update relationships between private desktops and other objects. For example, you can add a tag to a private desktop with: 
    Add-BrokerTag $tag -Desktop $desktop.Uid

Similarly, assign users to private desktops with: 
    Add-BrokerUser $user -PrivateDesktop $desktop

Many of the fields that can be set with this cmdlet can also be set with Set-BrokerMachine, such as MaintenanceMode. Using Set-BrokerMachine is preferred in these cases.

## Parameters

| Name   | Description | Required? | Pipeline Input | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| InputObject | Specifies the desktop or array of desktops to modify. You can also use an integer Uid of the desktop instead. | true | true (ByValue) |  |
| MachineName | Specifies the desktop to modify using its machine name (in the form 'domain\machine'). | true | true (ByPropertyName) |  |
| PassThru | This cmdlet does not generate any output, unless you use the PassThru parameter, in which case it returns the affected record. | false | false | False |
| AssignedClientName | Changes the client name assignment of the desktop. Set this to $null to remove the assignment. Desktops can be assigned to multiple users, a single IP address, or a single client name, but only to one of these categories at one time. | false | false |  |
| AssignedIPAddress | Changes the IP address assignment of the desktop. Set this to $null to remove the assignment. Desktops can be assigned to multiple users, a single IP address, or a single client name, but only to one of these categories at one time. | false | false |  |
| ColorDepth | Changes the color depth connections to this desktop should use.<br>Valid values are $null, FourBit, EightBit, SixteenBit, and TwentyFourBit. A value of $null results in the desktop group value being used instead. | false | false |  |
| Description | Changes the description of the desktop. This is seen only by Citrix Administrators and is not visible to users. | false | false |  |
| IconUid | Changes the icon displayed for this desktop. When this setting is $null, the icon displayed is determined by the desktop group. | false | false |  |
| InMaintenanceMode | Changes the maintenance mode setting of a desktop. When a desktop is in maintenance mode, it is not included as a candidate when brokering new sessions, and it does not participate in automatic power management (idle pool); however, it still responds to explicit power operations. | false | false |  |
| PublishedName | Changes the name displayed to the user for this desktop. When this setting is $null, the name displayed is determined by the PublishedName of the desktop group. | false | false |  |
| SecureIcaRequired | Changes whether or not SecureICA is required for connections to this desktop. When this setting is $null, the SecureIcaRequired setting from the desktop group is used. | false | false |  |
| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high level operation that this cmdlet call forms a part of. Desktop Studio and Desktop Director typically create High Level Operations. PowerShell scripts can also wrap a series of cmdlet calls in a High Level Operation by way of the Start-LogHighLevelOperation and Stop-LogHighLevelOperation cmdlets. | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller that the PowerShell snapin will connect to. This can be provided as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | Localhost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value will become the default. |

## Input Type
### Citrix.Broker.Admin.SDK.PrivateDesktop
   You can pipe PrivateDesktop objects into this cmdlet instead of on the command line with the -InputObject parameter.
## Return Values
### None or Citrix.Broker.Admin.SDK.PrivateDesktop
   This cmdlet does not generate any output, unless you use the PassThru parameter, in which case it generates a Citrix.Broker.Admin.SDK.PrivateDesktop object.
