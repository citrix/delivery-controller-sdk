## Parameters
| Name   | Description | Required? | Pipeline Input | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| InputObject | The session instances whose properties you want to set. | true | true (ByValue) |  |
| SessionKey | The session key (Guid) of the session whose properties you want to set. | true | true (ByPropertyName) |  |
| PassThru | This cmdlet does not generate any output, unless you use the PassThru parameter, in which case it returns the affected record. | false | false | False |
| Hidden | Changes whether the session is hidden or not. Hidden sessions are treated as though they do not exist when brokering sessions; a hidden session cannot be reconnected to, but a new session may be launched using the same entitlement.<br>A session may be hidden automatically by the system when an attempt is made to reconnect to a session that is unreachable due to, for example, the failure of a VM's hypervisor. This allows a new session to be brokered provided that other machines in the same desktop group are still available. If the original session still exists after the hypervisor is restored then it must be unhidden to allow the user to reconnect to it.<br>Only sessions for shared desktops or applications can be hidden or unhidden. Private desktop or application sessions can never be hidden. | false | false |  |
| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high level operation that this cmdlet call forms a part of. Desktop Studio and Desktop Director typically create High Level Operations. PowerShell scripts can also wrap a series of cmdlet calls in a High Level Operation by way of the Start-LogHighLevelOperation and Stop-LogHighLevelOperation cmdlets. | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller that the PowerShell snapin will connect to. This can be provided as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | Localhost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value will become the default. |
| BearerToken | Specifies the bearer token assigned to the calling user | false | false |  |
