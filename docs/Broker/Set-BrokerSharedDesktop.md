# Set-BrokerSharedDesktop

   Change the settings of a shared desktop.

## Syntax
```
Set-BrokerSharedDesktop [-InputObject] <SharedDesktop[]> [-PassThru] [-InMaintenanceMode <Boolean>] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Set-BrokerSharedDesktop [-MachineName] <String> [-PassThru] [-InMaintenanceMode <Boolean>] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## Detailed Description
   Shared desktops are automatically created when a machine is added to a desktop group with a DesktopKind of 'Shared', and these inherit default properties. Use Set-BrokerSharedDesktop to change the configuration settings of an existing shared desktop.

To specify shared desktops, you can choose whether to update by machine name or by passing a SharedDesktop or an array of SharedDesktop objects. You can also use the Uid or an array of Uids instead.

Most properties of a shared desktop cannot be modified as these contain status information; for example DNSName, RegistrationState, and OSVersion. You can change only the maintenance mode setting with this cmdlet.

Many of the properties that can be set with Set-BrokerSharedDesktop can be set by using Set-BrokerMachine (e.g. InMaintenanceMode). Using the Set-BrokerMachine cmdlet, where possible, is the preferred behaviour.

See about_Broker_Desktops for more information about desktops.

## Parameters

| Name   | Description | Required? | Pipeline Input | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| InputObject | Specifies the desktop or array of desktops to modify. You can also use an integer Uid of the desktop instead. | true | true (ByValue) |  |
| MachineName | Specifies the desktop to modify using its machine name (in the form 'domain\machine'). | true | true (ByPropertyName) |  |
| PassThru | This cmdlet does not generate any output, unless you use the PassThru parameter, in which case it returns the affected record. | false | false | False |
| InMaintenanceMode | Changes the maintenance mode setting of a desktop. When a desktop is in maintenance mode, it is not included as a candidate when brokering new sessions, and it does not participate in automatic power management (idle pool); however, it still responds to explicit power operations. | false | false |  |
| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high level operation that this cmdlet call forms a part of. Desktop Studio and Desktop Director typically create High Level Operations. PowerShell scripts can also wrap a series of cmdlet calls in a High Level Operation by way of the Start-LogHighLevelOperation and Stop-LogHighLevelOperation cmdlets. | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller that the PowerShell snapin will connect to. This can be provided as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | Localhost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value will become the default. |

## Input Type
### Citrix.Broker.Admin.SDK.SharedDesktop
   You can pipe SharedDesktop objects into this cmdlet instead of on the command line with the -InputObject parameter.
## Return Values
### None or Citrix.Broker.Admin.SDK.SharedDesktop
   This cmdlet does not generate any output, unless you use the PassThru parameter, in which case it generates a Citrix.Broker.Admin.SDK.SharedDesktop object.
