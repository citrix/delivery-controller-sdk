Start-BrokerNaturalDesktopGroupRebootCycle [-InputObject] <DesktopGroup[]> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [-BearerToken <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
Creating a natural reboot cycle for a desktop group ensures that all machines in the group are running the most recent image for the group.

The machines are rebooted in a non-disruptive manner, allowing machines that are in use to continue working and be restarted only after they become idle.
