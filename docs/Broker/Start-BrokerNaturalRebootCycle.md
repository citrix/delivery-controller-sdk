# Start-Brokernaturalrebootcycle
Reboots all machines from the specified catalog when they are not in use.
## Syntax
```
Start-BrokerNaturalRebootCycle [-InputObject] <Catalog[]> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [-BearerToken <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
Creating a natural reboot cycle for a catalog ensures that all machines in the catalog are running the most recent image for the catalog.

The machines are rebooted in a non-disruptive manner, allowing machines that are in use to continue working and be restarted only after they become idle.
