# Start-Brokerrebootcycle
Creates and starts a reboot cycle for each desktop group that contains machines from the specified catalog.
## Syntax
```
Start-BrokerRebootCycle [-InputObject] <Catalog[]> -RebootDuration <Int32> [-WarningDuration <Int32>] [-WarningTitle <String>] [-WarningMessage <String>] [-WarningRepeatInterval <Int32>] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [-BearerToken <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
The Start-BrokerRebootCycle cmdlet is used to create and start a reboot cycle for each desktop group that contains machines from the specified catalog. For a given desktop group, only the machines from the target catalog are rebooted and any machines from other catalogs are not rebooted.

Creating a reboot cycle for catalog ensures that all machines in the catalog are running the most recent image for the catalog and that all PvD image updates have been performed.

## Parameters
| Name   | Description | Required? | Pipeline Input | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| InputObject | Creates a reboot cycle for each desktop group that contains machines from this input catalog SDK object. The catalogs can be specified using UID values, name values (including wildcards) or catalog objects. | true | true (ByValue) |  |
| RebootDuration | Approximate maximum duration in minutes over which the reboot cycle runs. | true | false |  |
| WarningDuration | Time in minutes prior to a machine reboot at which a warning message is displayed in all user sessions on that machine. If the warning duration value is zero then no message is displayed. In some cases the time required to process a reboot cycle may exceed the RebootDuration time by up to the WarningDuration value; Citrix recommends that the WarningDuration is kept small relative to the RebootDuration value. | false | false |  |
| WarningTitle | The window title used when showing the warning message in user sessions on a machine scheduled for reboot. | false | false |  |
| WarningMessage | Warning message displayed in user sessions on a machine scheduled for reboot. If the message is blank then no message is displayed. The optional pattern '%m%' is replaced by the number of minutes until the reboot. | false | false |  |
| WarningRepeatInterval | Number of minutes to wait before showing the reboot warning message again. | false | false |  |
| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high level operation that this cmdlet call forms a part of. Desktop Studio and Desktop Director typically create High Level Operations. PowerShell scripts can also wrap a series of cmdlet calls in a High Level Operation by way of the Start-LogHighLevelOperation and Stop-LogHighLevelOperation cmdlets. | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller that the PowerShell snapin will connect to. This can be provided as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | Localhost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value will become the default. |
| BearerToken | Specifies the bearer token assigned to the calling user | false | false |  |
