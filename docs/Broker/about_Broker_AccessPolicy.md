## TOPIC
    Citrix Broker SDK - Access Policy 

## SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Controls client-connection-based access to desktop groups. 

## LONG DESCRIPTION
    The site's access policy defines rules controlling a user's access to 
    desktop groups. Access checks are based on details of the user's connection 
    from their user device to the site. Think of the access policy informally 
    as a connection-based firewall. 

    The access policy comprises a set of rules. Each rule: 

    o   Relates to a single desktop group. 
    o   Contains a set of connection filters and access right controls. 

    Multiple rules can apply to the same desktop group. 

    By default, users have no access to any desktop group within a site. A user 
    gains access to a group when their connection's details match the connection 
    filters of one or more rules in the access policy. 

    The access policy also grants control rights over desktop and application 
    sessions. For example, it can specify which protocols are allowed for a 
    connection from a given endpoint, and whether the user can restart their 
    machine. 

    To use a resource published by a site, the user must have both access to the 
    desktop group that contains it, and an entitlement to use the resource. 
    Entitlements are typically granted by the site entitlement and assignment 
    policies; see about_Broker_Policies for more information. 

## ACCESS POLICY RULES
    A single access policy rule relates to a single specified desktop group and 
    comprises a set of connection filters and access right grants as described 
    below. 

    Each rule can be individually enabled or disabled. A disabled rule is 
    ignored when the access policy is evaluated. 

  CONNECTION FILTERS OVERVIEW 
    The connection filters in an access policy rule comprise the following: 

    o   Local/remote client (SmartAccess) filters 
    o   Client IP address filters 
    o   Client name filters 
    o   User filters 

    All filters have an include and exclude form that can be individually 
    enabled or disabled. For a rule to be considered when the access policy is 
    evaluated, at least one connection include filter must be enabled. By 
    default, all filters, both include and exclude, are disabled. 

    The detailed behavior of connection filters is covered later. 

  ACCESS RIGHT CONTROLS OVERVIEW 
    The access right controls in an access policy rule comprise the following: 

    o   Allowed protocols 
    o   Whether machine restart, or programmatic session logoff, is allowed 

    The detailed behavior of access right controls is covered later. 

## DETAILS OF CONNECTION FILTERS
    To gain access to a desktop group the user's connection must match the 
    filter criteria of at least one access policy rule for that group. 

    To match a rule, a connection must match all the rule's enabled include 
    connection filters and must not match any of the rule's enabled exclude 
    filters. That is, entries in exclude filters take priority. 

    Because all rules are evaluated independently, if an exclude filter match 
    prevents a connection gaining access to a desktop group through one rule, 
    the connection may still gain access to the same group through a different 
    rule. 

    The filters are described in pairs below, but within a single rule a match 
    against any exclude filter prevents a connection from gaining access through 
    that rule irrespective of which include filters within the rule were also 
    matched. 

  SMARTACCESS FILTERS 
    SmartAccess filters allow filtering based on whether the client is directly 
    connected (for example over a local area network (LAN)) or through Access 
    Gateway. For connections through Access Gateway further filtering can be 
    performed based on the tags supplied from Access Gateway itself. The key 
    properties of SmartAccess filters are: 

    o   AllowedConnections (include filter: Filtered, NotViaAG, ViaAG) 

        This property controls the behavior of the include filter. The default 
        value is Filtered. The possible values are as follows: 

        -- Filtered (default) 

            The filter matches any user connection not through Access Gateway. 
            In addition, the filter may match user connections through Access 
            Gateway subject to the following: if the IncludedSmartAccessTags 
            property is empty, any such connection matches. However, if the 
            property is not empty at least one SmartAccess tag from the filter 
            property must match a SmartAccess tag supplied with the user's 
            connection. 

        -- NotViaAG 

            The filter matches only user connections not through Access 
            Gateway. The contents of the IncludedSmartAccessTags property 
            are ignored. 

        -- ViaAG 

            The filter matches only user connections through Access Gateway. 
            If the IncludedSmartAccessTags property is empty, any such 
            connection matches. However, if the property is not empty at 
            least one SmartAccess tag from the filter property must match a 
            SmartAccess tag supplied with the user's connection. 
             
        -- AnyViaAG 

            The filter matches only user connections through Access Gateway. 
            The contents of the IncludedSmartAccessTags property are ignored. 
            The behaviour of AnyViaAG is therefore the same as using ViaAG with 
            an empty IncludedSmartAccessTags property. 

        The IncludedSmartAccessTags property referred to above forms part of the 
        include filter and is used if AllowedConnections is set to Filtered or 
        ViaAG. It comprises a simple list of Access Gateway tags that are 
        matched against those provided in the user's connection details. 

    o   ExcludedSmartAccessTags (exclude filter) 

        A simple list of Access Gateway tags that are matched against those 
        provided in the user's connection details. If any tag in the list 
        matches one supplied with the user's connection, the user's connection 
        does not match the access policy rule containing the filter. 

        The exclude filter has no setting corresponding to the 
        AllowedConnections property so its behavior is determined only by the 
        ExcludedSmartAccessTags property. 

    SmartAccess filters are typically used to control local (through a LAN) and 
    remote (through Access Gateway) access to a site. A common model is to 
    define two access policy rules rules for a group, one for local access and 
    one for remote. The remote rule might impose restrictions on the user device 
    having appropriate antivirus software installed, and potentially exclude 
    certain user groups who would be allowed access over the corporate LAN 
    (see USER FILTERS below). 

  CLIENT IP FILTERS 
    Client IP filters allow filtering based on the IP address of the user's 
    device. The key properties of client IP filters are: 

    o   IncludedClientIPs (include filter) 

        A simple list of numeric IP address ranges that are matched against the 
        user device. The filter matches if the device address falls within any 
        of the ranges in the list. 

    o   ExcludedClientIPs (exclude filter) 

        A simple list of numeric IP address ranges that are matched against the 
        user device. If any entry matches the device address, the user's 
        connection does not match the access policy rule containing the filter. 

    An IP address range in these filters can be specified as a simple IP 
    address or as a range using a conventional subnet mask. 

  CLIENT NAME FILTERS 
    Client name filters allow filtering based on the name of the user's 
    device. The key properties of client name filters are: 

    o   IncludedClientNames (include filter) 

        A simple list of names that are matched against the user device. The 
        filter matches if the device name matches any value in the list. 

    o   ExcludedClientNames (exclude filter) 

        A simple list of device names that are matched against the user device. 
        If any entry matches the device name, the user's connection does not 
        match the access policy rule containing the filter. 

    Note: The form of the device name presented to the site depends on the site 
    configuration. For example, by default in these filters you cannot use the 
    form of the name presented by Web Interface. 

  USER FILTERS 
    User filters allow filtering based on the identity of the user. The key 
    properties of user filters are: 

    o   AllowedUsers (include filter: Filtered, AnyAuthenticated, Any) 

        This property controls the behavior of the include filter. The default 
        value is Filtered. The possible values are as follows: 

        -- Filtered (default) 

            The filter matches if the user's logon token contains one or more 
            users or user groups matching those specified in the IncludedUsers 
            property. The IncludedUsers property is a simple list of users or 
            user groups and is used only when the AllowedUsers property is set 
            to Filtered. 

        -- AnyAuthenticated 

            The filter matches any authenticated Microsoft Windows user. The 
            contents of the IncludedUsers property are ignored. 

        -- Any 

            The filter matches any user. The contents of the IncludedUsers 
            property are ignored. In the current implementation this value 
            is handled in the same way as AnyAuthenticated. 

    o   ExcludedUsers (exclude filter) 

        A simple list of users or user groups. If any entry matches one in the 
        user's logon token, the user's connection does not match the access 
        policy rule containing the filter. 

        The exclude filter has no setting corresponding to the AllowedUsers 
        property so its behavior is determined only by the ExcludedUsers 
        property. 

## DETAILS OF ACCESS RIGHT CONTROLS
    The access right controls of an access policy rule determine rights that the 
    user has over any desktop or application session that they obtain from the 
    rule's desktop group. 

    The rights apply only if the user's connection matches the connection 
    filters of a rule, and only if the user also has an entitlement to a desktop 
    or application session from the associated desktop group. 

    The following properties define the access rights: 

    o   AllowedProtocols 

        A simple list of communication protocols over which connections can be 
        made to resources published by the desktop group. For example, use this 
        to restrict protocols with high bandwidth requirements to connections 
        originating from a LAN. 

    o   AllowRestart 

        For single-session power-managed machines, allows the user to restart 
        the machine (the machine is powered off using the capabilities of its 
        hypervisor). For multi-session machines the user's session is simply 
        logged off. 

    For a given connection, if multiple rules result in access being granted to 
    a session from a desktop group, the user's rights are the combined rights of 
    all the rules that matched for that group. The allowed protocol lists from 
    all the rules are combined, and the user is granted restart rights if any 
    one rule has AllowRestart set.
