## SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Describes how to publish and manage hosted applications. 

## LONG DESCRIPTION
    Published applications allow your users to launch applications as if they 
    were installed on their devices when in fact they are hosted remotely. The 
    applications are normally launched in a seamless window, meaning that users 
    see only the application window and not an additional desktop. 

    Published applications are hosted on either desktop operating systems or 
    server operating systems. Applications are published to users and desktop 
    groups. As such, conceptually they exist "on top" of desktop groups, which 
    are themselves built on top of catalogs. See about_Broker_Concepts for more 
    information on catalogs. 

    There are three types of applications: 
    o   HostedOnDesktop - application runs on a remote machine and is displayed 
        on the local client desktop. 
    o   InstalledOnClient - application is installed and run on the local 
        client machine and has its window overlaid on to a remote desktop. 
    o   PublishedContent - application refers to actual content (using a URL   
        or UNC). File type associations determine what application is run to  
        view the content 
     

  HOSTING APPLICATIONS 
    There are three main ways of hosting an application: using a private 
    single-session VDI desktop, a shared single-session VDI desktop, and on 
    shared multi-session server operating systems. 

    An application hosted on a shared single-session VDI desktop, when launched, 
    is hosted on a random machine within the desktop group. An application 
    hosted on a private single-session VDI desktop ensures that when a user 
    launches the application it is always hosted on the same machine. An 
    application hosted on shared multi-session server operating systems ensures 
    that when a user launches the application it is always hosted on one of the 
    least loaded servers in the desktop group. 

    You control how the application is hosted based on the kind of desktop group 
    that you choose. Shared desktop groups randomly select a machine, and these 
    desktop groups can only be created from catalogs with a Random 
    AllocationType. On the other hand, private desktop groups host the 
    application on the same machine for that user every time, and these desktop 
    group types can only be created from catalogs with a Permanent 
    AllocationType. 

  USER ACCESS & ASSIGNMENT 
    Users are not assigned an application directly, but instead they are 
    required to first have access to the desktop groups on which the 
    applications are published through access policy rules. 

    With shared desktop groups, access to a published application also needs an 
    application entitlement policy rule. An application entitlement policy rule 
    defines the set of users who are allowed per-session access to desktops in a 
    specified desktop group. 

    With private desktop groups, access to a published application also needs an 
    application assignment policy rule. An application assignment policy rule 
    defines the set of users who are allowed access to a single application 
    session in a desktop group. 

    Users are assigned private machines in one of two ways: pre-assigned or 
    assign-on-first-use. Pre-assigned means that individual user accounts have 
    been specified for the machines within that desktop group. A single machine 
    can only have a single user account (not a group account) assigned to it, 
    and likewise a user can only be assigned a single machine within a desktop 
    group. 

    Assign-on-first-use requires less configuration. Machines are assigned to 
    users the first time they log on. Rather than allocating users directly to 
    machines, instead users are assigned to the private desktop group, either 
    through individual user accounts or through user group accounts. Then, when 
    a user assigned to the desktop group logs on, a machine is automatically 
    allocated to them. 

  USER VISIBILITY 
    Users can be further filtered by configuring the visibility filter on top of 
    the application. This restricts the application to a subset of the users 
    that were granted access by the access policy and entitlement/assignment 
    policy rules on the desktop group. 

  MULTIPLE DESKTOP GROUPS 
    You can publish an application to multiple desktop groups, which have to be 
    of the same kind. Generally, an application that is published only to 
    private desktop groups is referred to as a "private application". An 
    application that is only published to shared desktop groups is referred to 
    as a "shared application". 

  APPLICATION GROUPS 
    An application group is a group of applications. Applications may be 
    published either by adding them directly to a desktop group, or they may 
    first be assigned to an application group, which may then be added to a 
    desktop group. Adding an application group to a desktop group publishes all 
    of the application group's applications to that desktop group in a single 
    operation. The set of machines on which the application group's applications 
    can be launched may then be restricted further by tagging the desired 
    machines and setting the application group's RestrictToTag property. 

    Grouping applications together allows for them to be administered as a 
    single unit. For example: 
    o   Moving an application group to a different desktop group has the same 
        effect as moving each of the applications, without the need to move each 
        application individually. 
    o   Disabling an application group disables each application in the group. 
    o   Application groups have a visibility filter that applies to every 
        application within the group (see 'User visibility' above). 

    Application groups may be configured to allow or disallow session sharing 
    with applications published by other application groups. For example, you 
    may have a particular set of applications that do not interoperate well with 
    certain other applications that are installed on the same machines - for 
    example, two different versions of the same software suite, or two different 
    versions of the same web browser. You may prefer not to allow the user to 
    launch both versions in the same session. 

    In such a case, an application group can be created for each version of the 
    software suite, and the applications for each version of the software suite 
    added to the corresponding application group. If session sharing is disabled 
    for each of the application groups, then the user will be able to run 
    applications of the same version in the same session, and can still run 
    other applications at the same time - but not in the same session. If the 
    user launches one of the different-versioned applications, which are in a 
    different application group, or launches any application that is not 
    contained in an application group, then that application is launched in a 
    new session. 

    IMPORTANT. The session sharing feature of application groups is not intended 
    to be a security sandboxing feature. In addition to not being foolproof, it 
    cannot prevent users from launching applications into their sessions through 
    other means (e.g. through Windows Explorer). 

    An application may be a member of more than one application group. In that 
    case, it inherits settings from all of the application groups of which it is 
    a member. For example, an application is only disabled if all of the 
    application groups to which it is assigned are disabled, or if the 
    application itself is disabled. 

    However, if application or application group visiblity filters are used, 
    then it is recommended that each application be a member of at most one 
    application group, and that visibility filters are used either on 
    applications, or on application groups, but not both. This is because it is 
    not generally possible for the system to combine multiple visibility filters 
    in such as way that they can consistently be enforced. 

    An application may also be a member of both an application group and a 
    desktop group at the same time. However, this is not recommended, because 
    the additional complexity can make it harder for the administrator to 
    predict how machines are allocated to users. It is recommended that each 
    application be published either via application groups, or via desktop 
    groups, but not both. 

    Application groups may not be published via private desktop groups. 

    Application groups are purely an administrative concept. They are not 
    visible to end users. 

  LICENSING 
    Hosted applications need the appropriate licenses to exist on the license 
    server to be functional. 

  NAMING 
    Applications have three names that identify them: the Name, BrowserName and 
    the PublishedName. The Name is unique for each application, is not visible 
    to the user, and is primarily used for administrative purpose. The 
    BrowserName is unique across the entire site, and is primarily used 
    internally. The PublishedName is not unique and is the name seen by end 
    users who have access to this application. 

    When creating an application, you only need to specify the Name. If no 
    BrowserName is specified one is automatically generated. If no PublishedName 
    is specified by default it is the same as the Name. 

    The following special characters are not allowed in the Name, BrowserName or 
    the PublishedName properties: \ / ; : # . * ? = &lt; &gt; | [ ] ( ) " ' 
       
    In addition the ` character is not allowed in the Name property. 

    To change the PublishedName or BrowserName of an application you must use 
    the Set-BrokerApplication cmdlet. 

    To change the Name of an application you must use the 
    Rename-BrokerApplication cmdlet. 

  OPTIONAL 
    You can configure file-type associations for applications, so that if a user 
    double-clicks a document icon on their device, a published application 
    automatically starts. For more information, see the help for 
    New-BrokerConfiguredFTA. 

    You can apply tags to applications as another convenient way to further 
    organize (and search for) applications. For more information, see the help 
    for New-BrokerTag. 

  CMDLETS 
    New-BrokerApplication 
        Creates an application for publishing after the needed desktop groups, 
        access policy and entitlement/assignment policy rules have been created. 

    Add-BrokerApplication 
        Adds one or more applications to a desktop group. 

    Get-BrokerApplication 
        Gets one or more applications. 

    Remove-BrokerApplication 
        Deletes one or more applications or it can be used to delete just the 
        association of an application to a desktop group. 

    Rename-BrokerApplication 
        Changes the Name of an application. 

    Set-BrokerApplication 
        Changes the settings of application objects, except their names. 

## EXAMPLES

  SHARED APPLICATION (SingleSession) 
    You have created a catalog with a Random AllocationType and SingleSession 
    SessionSupport. It contains two machines called worker1 and worker2, both in 
    the ACME domain. You publish an application with shared hosting as follows: 

    C:\PS> Write-Host "Create a desktop group, and add machines to it" 
    C:\PS> $dg = New-BrokerDesktopGroup "Shared Application Group" 
    -DesktopKind Shared -DeliveryType AppsOnly -SessionSupport 'SingleSession' 
    C:\PS> $m1 = Get-BrokerMachine -MachineName "ACME\worker1" 
    C:\PS> $m2 = Get-BrokerMachine -MachineName "ACME\worker2" 
    C:\PS> Add-BrokerMachine $m1 -DesktopGroup $dg 
    C:\PS> Add-BrokerMachine $m2 -DesktopGroup $dg 
    C:\PS> Write-Host "Create access policy rule for desktop group" 
    C:\PS> New-BrokerAccessPolicyRule -Name "Shared Application Group - Allow Everyone Access" 
    -Enabled $true -DesktopGroupUid $dg.Uid -IncludedUserFilterEnabled $true 
    -AllowedProtocols @("HDX") -AllowedUsers AnyAuthenticated 
    C:\PS> Write-Host "Create application entitlement policy for desktop group" 
    C:\PS> New-BrokerAppEntitlementPolicyRule -Name "Shared Application Group - App Entitlement" 
    -IncludedUsers 'ACME\Domain Users' -DesktopGroupUid $dg.Uid -Enabled $true 
    C:\PS> Write-Host "Create an application" 
    C:\PS> New-BrokerApplication -Name "Notepad" -PublishedName "Notepad" 
    -CommandLineExecutable "notepad.exe" -DesktopGroup $dg.Uid 

    In turn, this set of commands: creates a shared single session desktop group 
    for applications delivery; adds two machines (from a catalog with a Random 
    AllocationType and SingleSession SessionSupport) to the desktop group; 
    creates access policy and application entitlement policy rules; creates an 
    application; specifies its name, the executable, and links the application 
    to the desktop group that will host it. 

  SHARED APPLICATION (MultiSession) 
    You have created a catalog with a Random AllocationType and MultiSession 
    SessionSupport. It contains one machine called worker1 in the ACME domain. 
    You publish an application with shared hosting as follows: 

    C:\PS> Write-Host "Create a desktop group, and add machines to it" 
    C:\PS> $dg = New-BrokerDesktopGroup "Shared Application Group" 
    -DesktopKind Shared -DeliveryType AppsOnly -SessionSupport 'MultiSession' 
    C:\PS> $m1 = Get-BrokerMachine -MachineName "ACME\worker1" 
    C:\PS> Add-BrokerMachine $m1 -DesktopGroup $dg 
    C:\PS> Write-Host "Create access policy rule for desktop group" 
    C:\PS> New-BrokerAccessPolicyRule -Name "Shared Application Group - Allow Everyone Access" 
    -Enabled $true -DesktopGroupUid $dg.Uid -IncludedUserFilterEnabled $true 
    -AllowedProtocols @("HDX") -AllowedUsers AnyAuthenticated 
    C:\PS> Write-Host "Create application entitlement policy for desktop group" 
    C:\PS> New-BrokerAppEntitlementPolicyRule -Name "Shared Application Group - App Entitlement" 
    -IncludedUsers 'ACME\Domain Users' -DesktopGroupUid $dg.Uid -Enabled $true 
    C:\PS> Write-Host "Create an application" 
    C:\PS> New-BrokerApplication -Name "Notepad" -PublishedName "Notepad" 
    -CommandLineExecutable "notepad.exe" -DesktopGroup $dg.Uid 

    In turn, this set of commands: creates a shared multi session desktop group 
    for applications delivery; adds one machine (from a catalog with a Random 
    AllocationType and MultiSession SessionSupport) to the desktop group; 
    creates access policy and application entitlement policy rules; creates an 
    application; specifies its name, the executable, and links the application 
    to the desktop group that will host it. 

  PRIVATE PRE-ASSIGNED APPLICATION 
    You have a catalog with a Permanent AllocationType and SingleSession 
    SessionSupport. It contains two machines called worker1 and worker2, both in 
    the ACME domain. You publish an application with private hosting using 
    pre-assigned machines as follows: 

    C:\PS> Write-Host "Create a desktop group, and add machines to it" 
    C:\PS> $dg = New-BrokerDesktopGroup "Private App G1" -DesktopKind Private 
    -DeliveryType AppsOnly -SessionSupport 'SingleSession' 
    C:\PS> $m1 = Get-BrokerMachine -MachineName "ACME\worker1" 
    C:\PS> $m2 = Get-BrokerMachine -MachineName "ACME\worker2" 
    C:\PS> Add-BrokerMachine $m1 -DesktopGroup $dg 
    C:\PS> Add-BrokerMachine $m2 -DesktopGroup $dg 
    C:\PS> Write-Host "Setting access policy rule for desktop group" 
    C:\PS> New-BrokerAccessPolicyRule -Name "Private App G1 - Allow Everyone Access" 
    -Enabled $true -DesktopGroupUid $dg.Uid -IncludedUserFilterEnabled $true 
    -AllowedProtocols @("HDX") -AllowedUsers AnyAuthenticated 
    C:\PS> Write-Host "Pre-Assign users to the machines" 
    C:\PS> Add-BrokerUser "ACME\user1" -Machine $m1 
    C:\PS> Add-BrokerUser "ACME\user2" -Machine $m2 
    C:\PS> Write-Host "Create an application" 
    C:\PS> New-BrokerApplication -Name "Notepad" -PublishedName "Notepad" 
    -CommandLineExecutable "notepad.exe" -DesktopGroup $dg.Uid 

    In turn, this set of commands: creates a private desktop group for 
    applications delivery; adds two machines (from a catalog with a Permanent 
    AllocationType and SingleSession SessionSupport) to the desktop group; 
    creates access policy; creates two user objects; pre-assigns a user to each 
    machine; creates the application; assigns users to it; and links the 
    application to the desktop group that will host it. 

  PRIVATE, ASSIGN-ON-FIRST-USE APPLICATION 
    You have a catalog created with a Permanent AllocationType and SingleSession 
    SessionSupport. It contains two machines called worker1 and worker2, both in 
    the ACME domain. You publish an application with private hosting using 
    assign-on-first-use machines as follows: 

    C:\PS> Write-Host "Create a desktop group, and add machines to it" 
    C:\PS> $dg = New-BrokerDesktopGroup "Private App G2" -DesktopKind Private 
    -DeliveryType AppsOnly -SessionSupport 'SingleSession' 
    C:\PS> $m1 = Get-BrokerMachine -MachineName "ACME\worker1" 
    C:\PS> $m2 = Get-BrokerMachine -MachineName "ACME\worker2" 
    C:\PS> Add-BrokerMachine $m1 -DesktopGroup $dg 
    C:\PS> Add-BrokerMachine $m2 -DesktopGroup $dg 
    C:\PS> Write-Host "Setting access policy rule for desktop group" 
    C:\PS> New-BrokerAccessPolicyRule -Name "Private App G1 - Allow Everyone Access" 
    -Enabled $true -DesktopGroupUid $dg.Uid -IncludedUserFilterEnabled $true 
    -AllowedProtocols @("HDX") -AllowedUsers AnyAuthenticated 
    C:\PS> Write-Host "Create application assignment policy for desktop group" 
    C:\PS> New-BrokerAppAssignmentPolicyRule -Name "Private App G2 - App Assignment" 
    -IncludedUsers 'ACME\Domain Users' -DesktopGroupUid $dg.Uid -Enabled $true 
    C:\PS> Write-Host "Create an application" 
    C:\PS> New-BrokerApplication -Name "Notepad" -PublishedName "Notepad" 
    -CommandLineExecutable "notepad.exe" -DesktopGroup $dg.Uid 

    In turn, this set of commands: creates a private single session desktop 
    group for applications delivery; adds two machines (from a catalog with a 
    Permanent AllocationType and SingleSession SessionSupport) to the desktop 
    group; creates access policy and application assignment policy rules; 
    creates the application, and links the application to the desktop group that 
    will host it.
