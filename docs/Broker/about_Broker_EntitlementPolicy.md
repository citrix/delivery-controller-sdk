## Topic
Citrix Broker SDK - Desktop and Application Entitlement Policy


## Short Description
Controls end-user entitlement to desktop and application sessions provided from a pool of shared machines.


## Long Description
The site's entitlement policy defines rules controlling users' entitlements to desktop and application sessions from pools of shared machines. Each pool is defined by a desktop group.

The entitlement policy comprises a set of rules. Each rule grants users a single entitlement to a desktop or application session in a specified desktop group. The policy can  be applied only to groups of desktop kind Random. For desktop entitlements multiple rules can apply to the same group, however for application entitlements only a single rule can apply to a given group.

When the user starts a session by selecting an entitlement the behavior depends on the session-support property of the desktop group:


* For single-session groups the user is temporarily assigned a machine selected at random from the group to provide their session. When the session ends, the machine is returned to the pool of available machines.
* For multi-session groups the user session is provided by the machine that is least loaded within the group when the session is launched.

If multiple desktop entitlement rules for the same group contain the same user, the user can have as many desktop sessions from the group concurrently as they have entitlements.

Although only a single application entitlement rule can be defined for a group, a user can still launch multiple applications from that group because the applications all run within that entitlement's single session.

Rules for desktop and application session entitlements are distinct. Desktop entitlements are managed through the BrokerEntitlementPolicyRule SDK object, and application rules through the BrokerAppEntitlementPolicyRule object.

Desktop entitlement rules can be created only for desktop groups with delivery types DesktopsOnly or DesktopsAndApps, whereas an application entitlement rule can be created only for delivery types AppsOnly or DesktopsAndApps.

For desktop groups with delivery type DesktopsAndApps, typically one or more desktop session entitlement rules together with a single application session entitlement rule exist.

For an entitlement granted by the entitlement policy to be available to a user, the site's access policy must also grant them access to the desktop group.


## Entitlement Policy Rules
Each entitlement policy rule has the following key properties:


* The desktop group to which it applies (one rule only ever applies to one group)
* The users to whom the entitlement is granted

Additionally for desktop entitlement rules, the following properties exist:


* The published name of the entitlement (visible to the user)
* Any properties that a desktop session launched using the entitlement should use that differ from the defaults specified on the desktop group

If multiple desktop entitlements are available to a user from the same group the resultant desktop session properties may differ depending on which entitlement the user selects to start the session.

Each rule can be individually enabled or disabled. A disabled rule is ignored when the entitlement policy is evaluated.


### User Filters (Full)
Each rule has two user filters, an include filter and an exclude filter:


* The include filter contains users and user groups that are granted an entitlement to a session
* The exclude filter contains users and user groups that are denied an entitlement to a session

If the include filter of a rule contains multiple instances of a user (either explicit or implicit), they get only one entitlement by that rule.

Entries in the exclude filter take priority, so if a user appears explicitly or implicitly in both filters, access is denied. Typically, you use this filter to exclude a user or group of users who would otherwise gain access because they are members of a user group specified in the include filter.

Because all rules are independently evaluated, the exclude filter can only exclude users who would otherwise gain an entitlement through the same rule's include filter. That is, if a user is in a rule's include filter but not its exclude filter, the rule is guaranteed to grant that user a session entitlement irrespective of whether the user appears in the exclude filter of other rules.

If a filter contains a user group that contains other users and groups, the filter implicitly includes all of those users and groups.

By default the exclude filter is disabled.

To maintain entitlement policy rules that can be fully displayed and edited with Citrix Studio, use the simplified user filter model below and do not use the exclude filter.


### User Filters (Simplified)
The included user filter described above also supports a simplified usage model where the filter itself is disabled. When this is done, any user who has access to the desktop group through the access policy is implicitly granted an entitlement to a session through the entitlement policy rule without the need to list the user in the rule's include filter.

This is useful in cases where the access policy for the desktop group already explicitly specifies the users who should have access.

Even if the include filter is disabled, the exclude filter can still be used to deny the entitlement from users who would otherwise gain access through the access policy alone.


### Additional Desktop Entitlement Rule Properties
Desktop entitlement rules specify the following additional properties:


* PublishedName
* Description
* IconUid
* ColorDepth
* SecureIcaRequired

The published name, description, and icon UID properties apply to the desktop entitlement itself and determine the way in which the entitlement is presented to the user in, for example, StoreFront.

The color depth and secure ICA properties apply to the desktop session that is obtained when the entitlement is used.

In all cases, these properties can be explicitly specified. However, a null value (the default) means that the corresponding property is taken from the desktop group to which the rule applies. This inheritance from groups is dynamic; if the property of the group changes, the property of the entitlement changes too.


## Notes
If a rule grants an entitlement to a user group, the session entitlement applies to the individual user who selects the entitlement. However, this does not prevent a different user in the same user group from using the same entitlement concurrently. So, a rule that grants an entitlement to a user group containing multiple users allows each user concurrent access to a single session from the desktop group.

The total number of entitlements defined by the policy may exceed the number of machines available, or the maximum allowed sessions, from the desktop group. A user attempting to use an entitlement when no further resources are available receives a no-desktop-available error.

If a session launched through an entitlement is active when the entitlement rule is deleted, the session continues unaffected. However:


  * When the user ends the session, they cannot start a new one if the deleted rule was their only entitlement to a session in that group
  * If the user disconnects the session, they cannot reconnect to it
