## TOPIC
    Citrix Broker SDK - Access, Entitlement, and Assignment Policies 

## SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Overview of the site policies that control users' access to desktop and 
    application sessions. 

## LONG DESCRIPTION
    For an end user to access a desktop or application resource within a site, 
    they must have both an entitlement to use the resource, and have access to 
    the desktop group that contains the resource. 

    Entitlements to use resources can be granted by one of the following means: 

    o   The site entitlement policy grants entitlements to launch a shared 
        desktop or application session from a pool of shared machines. 
    o   The site assignment policy grants entitlements for "self service" 
        permanent assignment of machines to users for running desktop or 
        application sessions, and is referred to as "Assign On First Use" (AOFU) 
    o   Machines can be permanently assigned ("pre-assigned") to users by the 
        administrator to run either desktop or application sessions. 
    o   Machines can be configured to allow automatic permanent assignment to 
        their normal user (using the RemotePC feature). 

    A user must also be granted access to the desktop group that contains the 
    resource. These access rights are controlled by the site's access policy. 

    The access policy controls access using details of the user's device 
    such as whether it's connected over a local area network (LAN) or connected 
    through Access Gateway, the user device's name, IP address or subnet, and 
    the requested connection protocol. The user's identity can also feed into 
    the access check allowing, for example, certain users access to resources 
    only when locally connected to the site, but others full remote access. 

    Access and entitlements can be combined to allow rich and fine-grained 
    control over which users have access to site resource from any given user 
    device or location. 

    Each site has a single access policy, entitlement policy, and assignment 
    policy. Each policy comprises a set of rules. Policies are defined by 
    adding, removing, or changing rules. 

    Each site policy can also be viewed as a set of distinct policies each 
    relating to a single desktop group. In general a group has one or more 
    policy rules that relate to it, however each rule relates to only a single 
    group. Thus the rules that grant entitlement and access rights to a desktop 
    group define the policy for that group and that group only; changing this 
    policy has no impact on the entitlement and access rights for any other 
    other group in the site. 

    For detailed information about defining policy rules, see:

    The mapping of policies to the resources that they make available within a 
    site is described briefly below. For specific information on configuring 
    each category of resource, consult the more detailed help topics listed. 

  SHARED DESKTOP AND APPLICATION SESSIONS 
    To grant access to a group of shared machines, use the access and 
    entitlement policies: 

    o   The access policy grants access to the desktop group containing the 
        machines to be shared. 
    o   The entitlement policy grants an entitlement to use one or more machines 
        in the group to specified users or groups of users. 

    Groups of shared machines can be used to deliver full desktop or seamless 
    application sessions, or both. 

    For more detailed information about configuring shared machines, see: 
        help about_Broker_AccessPolicy 
        help about_Broker_EntitlementPolicy 

  PRE-ASSIGNED PRIVATE MACHINES 
    To grant access to private machines, use the access policy and a machine 
    assignment: 

    o   The access policy grants access to the desktop group containing the 
        machines. 
    o   The assignment links the desktop to a specified user. You can assign a 
        machine to just one user, multiple users or user groups. However, for 
        single-session machines, only one user can access the machine at a time. 

    Private machines can be used to deliver full desktop or seamless application 
    sessions (but not both). 

    For more detailed information about configuring private machines, see: 
        help about_Broker_AccessPolicy 
        help Add-BrokerUser 

  ASSIGN-ON-FIRST-USE (AOFU) MACHINES 
    To grant access to a desktop group containing assignable machines, use the 
    access policy and the assignment policy: 

    o   The access policy grants access to the desktop group containing the pool 
        of machines. 
    o   The assignment policy grants users a self-service entitlement to pick 
        one or more machines from the pool. 

    AOFU machines can be used to deliver full desktop or seamless application 
    sessions (but not both from the same desktop group). 

    For more detailed information about configuring AOFU desktops, see: 
        help about_Broker_AccessPolicy 
        help about_Broker_AssignmentPolicy 

  REMOTE PC MACHINES 
    The RemotePC feature allows existing physical machines to be assigned 
    automatically to their normal user thus allowing them remote access to their 
    own machine but without the need for the administrator to individually 
    configure access to each machine. 

    For more detailed information about configuring the Remote PC feature, see: 
        help about_Broker_RemotePC
