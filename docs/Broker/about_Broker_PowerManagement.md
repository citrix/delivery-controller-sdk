## TOPIC
    Citrix Broker SDK - Machine Power Management 

## SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Describes power management of machines used for desktops and applications. 

## LONG DESCRIPTION
    The Citrix Broker Service is in day-to-day control of the power state of 
    the configured desktop and application machines. The Broker Service can 
    control several hypervisors, each hypervisor connection being handled by 
    its own site service, so all Broker Service communication to the hypervisor 
    is through one of the controllers in the site. 

## HYPERVISOR CONNECTIONS
    Each hypervisor, or pool of linked hypervisors, is described and configured 
    through the XdHyp pseudo-drive and associated Hyp PowerShell commands 
    (cmdlets) which are provided by the host service snap-in. When you have 
    first created the hypervisor connection using the host service cmdlets, you 
    can create a broker equivalent object that references the Hyp instance using 
    a GUID value. Use the broker's HypervisorConnection object to nominate a 
    preferred controller for direct communication with the hypervisor on behalf 
    of all other controllers for day-to-day power actions and status requests. 

## POWER ACTIONS AND THROTTLING
    The site, through the Broker Service, can control the power state of the 
    machines used by the site for desktops and applications. Power state changes 
    can have a number of causes: 

    o   Power policy rules, such as requests to shut down or suspend machines 
        when user sessions on those machines end or are disconnected 
    o   If allowed, user-driven desktop restarts 
    o   Session launch requests requiring machines to be started 
    o   Pool size management, which controls the number of running machines 
    o   Direct administrator request using the SDK or Citrix Studio 
    o   Reboot schedules and cycles 
    o   Performing personal vDisk inventory activities 
    o   Cleaning machines back to the golden master image state after 
        they have been used 

    The power state changes of machines hosting desktops and applications are 
    controlled using a queuing mechanism. Actions to change the power state 
    are assigned a priority and are sent to the hypervisor according to a 
    throttling mechanism. This avoids overloading the hypervisor. 

    The queuing and throttling mechanisms take place on a 
    per-hypervisor-connection basis; each hypervisor connection's queue is 
    dealt with independently. You can view the contents of the queues using 
    the Get-BrokerHostingPowerAction cmdlet. This includes recently completed, 
    in-progress, and pending actions (that is, those due to be sent to the 
    hypervisor based on the throttling settings). 

    Each power action object comprises: 

    o    The machine to be acted on (Name, DNS Name, Hosting Name) 
    o    The action to be performed (TurnOn, TurnOff, Shutdown, 
         Reset, Restart, Suspend, or Resume) 
    o    The action's priority (Base, the original priority, and 
         Actual, the current priority) 
    o    The action's state (Pending, Started, Completed, Failed, 
         Canceled, Deleted, or Lost) 
    o    Time stamps of the action's lifecycle points (when it was created, 
         started, or completed) 
    o    Any reason the action failed 

    The throttling of power actions is controlled by three metadata values on 
    the Hyp hypervisor connection object when accessed through the XdHyp 
    pseudo-drive. The four values throttle power actions according to: 

    o    The maximum absolute number of in-progress power actions 
    o    The maximum number of in-progress power actions expressed as 
         a percentage of the total number of machines controlled by 
         the hypervisor connection 
    o    The maximum number of new power actions sent to the 
         hypervisor per minute 
    o    The maximum number of in-progress PvD inventory activities 
         expressed as a percentage of the total number of machines 
         controlled by the hypervisor connection 

    You add power actions to the queue using the SDK's 
    New-BrokerHostingPowerAction cmdlet. You cancel power actions in the queue 
    using the Remove-BrokerHostingPowerAction cmdlet. You boost or reduce their 
    priority using the Set-BrokerHostingPowerAction cmdlet. 

    You can also schedule power actions to be executed in the future, using the 
    New-BrokerDelayedHostingPowerAction command. Only Shutdown and Suspend 
    actions can be scheduled in this way. You can view these delayed power 
    actions using Get-BrokerDelayedHostingPowerAction and cancel them with 
    Remove-BrokerDelayedHostingPowerAction. When a delayed power action is ready 
    to be executed it is deleted, and a corresponding normal power action is 
    placed in the queue described above. 

## POWER POLICY
    Policy rules associated with a desktop group allow you to change power 
    states at configurable times after session state changes, typically a set 
    number of minutes after session disconnection or session logout. 

    Note that these policy rules are defined directly as properties of the 
    desktop group. 

    These policy actions allow the following operations to be specified: 

    o   A power action to be performed at a defined period after a session is 
        disconnected 
    o   A power action to be performed at a defined extended period after a 
        session is disconnected 
    o   A power action to be performed at a defined period after a session is 
        logged off 

    The two disconnect policy actions are designed to allow multi-stage policies 
    such as initially suspending a machine shortly after a session disconnect 
    occurs, and then later powering-off the machine if the session has not been 
    reconnected. 

    At the set time after the session state change, the required action is added 
    to the power action queue, and this is then throttled and processed as 
    normal. 

## POOL SIZE MANAGEMENT
    You can manage flexibly the number of machines running desktops and 
    applications using the pool size. For any given hour of the day and day of 
    the week, this is an absolute number of machines or the percentage of the 
    total number of machines in the desktop group. The pool size specifies the 
    total number of machines that are always running, regardless of whether they 
    are in use or idle. (Note: The number of machines does not depend on their 
    idle status, but this does affect the buffer size value, which is also used 
    to manage pool sizes.) 

    To start or shut down desktop machines to achieve the desired pool size, the 
    system places power actions in the queue. Standard throttling queue 
    management sends these to the hypervisors. A single desktop group (and its 
    pool) can span multiple hypervisors, so actions to start and shut down 
    machines can be added to multiple queues. 

  POWER TIME SCHEMES 
    Each single-session desktop group can be associated with one or more power 
    time schemes, each scheme covering a number of days of the week. The time 
    schemes specify, for each hour of the day, whether that hour is peak or 
    off-peak. They also specify the number of running unassigned machines 
    maintained by the broker. 

    You can configure other settings, such as buffer size and any power policy 
    rules differently for peak and off-peak hours. You can define the number of 
    running machines, idle or in use, either as an absolute value or as a 
    percentage of the desktop group size. Machines running desktops and 
    applications are started (or shut down when not in use) to match the 
    required pool size. 

    Each power time scheme comprises: 

    o    The name of the scheme 
    o    The pattern of days of the week covered by the scheme 
    o    The set of hours considered peak and off peak 
    o    The set of pool size values (one for each hour of the day) 

    The hours of the day used by time schemes are the hours in the time zone for 
    the desktop group the scheme is associated with. You cannot associate one 
    desktop group with multiple time schemes covering the same day of the week. 

  BUFFER SIZE 
    In addition to the pool size, you can optionally configure two buffer sizes 
    for each desktop group, one for peak hours and one for off-peak hours. The 
    buffer size defines the minimum number of idle unassigned machines 
    maintained by the broker and is specified as a percentage of the total 
    machines in the group. These are running machines that are not used by any 
    user session. The buffer size on its own never causes machines to shut down. 
    It causes them to start up so a minimum number of idle machine is always 
    available. The buffer size in conjunction with the pool size can cause 
    machines running desktops or applications to be shut down. 

  POWER MANAGEMENT OF ASSIGNED MACHINES 
    Automatic power management for private desktop groups provides the ability 
    to power on all assigned machines at the transition to a peak period and 
    respectively power off all machines at the transition to an off-peak period. 

    If a machine is shut down during peak hours it will not be automatically 
    powered on again, unless the AutomaticPowerOnForAssignedDuringPeak property 
    on the desktop group is also enabled. 

    Note that all power management facilities apply only to single session 
    machines. 

## REBOOT SCHEDULES
    Reboot schedules are commonly used after image updates or to perform regular 
    reboots of all machines in a desktop group or catalog to clear down problems 
    resulting from a corrupt state or hung/faulty applications. 

    Reboot schedules allow distributing the reboot operation of all machines 
    over a provided duration. Individual machine reboots are scheduled in a way 
    that attempts to maintain maximum availability of machines in the group as 
    the reboots occur, and avoid boot storms that overload the underlying 
    infrastructure. 

    Reboot schedules are the only form of automatic power management that can 
    shut down a machine while users are logged on; however the administrator can 
    provide a warning message to be displayed to end users at a specified period 
    prior to the shutdown taking effect. 

  REBOOT CYCLES 
    Reboot cycles describe the dynamic execution of desktop group or catalog 
    reboot operations. Reboot cycles can be created due to reboot schedules, or 
    by on-demand reboot operations requested via the SDK. 

    RebootCycle objects encapsulate the details of the associated reboot 
    operation and can be queried to show the current status. 

## STATUS
    You can view the status of the hypervisor connection on the broker 
    hypervisor connection object. You can obtain any hypervisor alerts using the 
    Get-BrokerHypervisorAlert cmdlet. You can check the power state of machines 
    running desktops or applications using the relevant Machine or Desktop 
    objects.
