## Detailed Description
   Use this cmdlet to register service instance items in the Configuration Service. Service instances can be registered either by retrieving the data directly from other services or by manually entering the details into this command.

If the service group specified by the service instance already exists, the service is added to the service group, otherwise a new service group is created to hold the service instance.
