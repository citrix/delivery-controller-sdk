| StartTime | Gets low level operations with the specified start time | false | false |  |
| EndTime | Gets low level operations with the specified end time. | false | false |  |
| IsSuccessful | Gets low level operations with the specified success indicator. | false | false |  |
| User | Gets low level operations logged by the specified administrator. | false | false |  |

| Text | Gets low level operations with the specified text | false | false |  |
| Source | Gets low level operations with the specified source. | false | false |  |
| SourceSdk | Gets low level operations logged from the SDK with the specified identifier. | false | false |  |
| OperationType | Gets low level operations with the specified operation type. Values can be:<br>o AdminActivity - to get operations which log administration activity.<br>o ConfigurationChange - to get operations which log configuration changes. | false | false |  |
| TargetType | Gets low level operations with the specified target type. The target type describes the type of object that was the target of the configuration change. For example, "Session" or "Machine". | false | false |  |
| Property | Specifies the properties to be returned. This is similar to piping the output of the command through Select-Object, but the properties are filtered more efficiently at the server. | false | false |  |
| ReturnTotalRecordCount | When specified, the cmdlet outputs an error record containing the number of records available. This error record is additional information and does not affect the objects written to the output pipeline. See about\_Log\_Filtering for details. | false | false | False |
| MaxRecordCount | Specifies the maximum number of records to return. | false | false | 250 |
| Skip | Skips the specified number of records before returning results. Also reduces the count returned by -ReturnTotalRecordCount. | false | false | 0 |
| SortBy | Sorts the results by the specified list of properties. The list is a set of property names separated by commas, semi-colons, or spaces. Optionally, prefix each name with a + or - to indicate ascending or descending order. Ascending order is assumed if no prefix is present. | false | false | The default sort order is by name or unique identifier. |
| Filter | Gets records that match a PowerShell-style filter expression. See about\_Log\_Filtering for details. | false | false |  |
| BearerToken | Specifies the bearer token assigned to the calling user | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller the PowerShell snap-in will connect to. You can provide this as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | Localhost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value becomes the default. |
