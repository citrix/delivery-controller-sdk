## Parameters
| Name   | Description | Required? | Pipeline Input | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| State | Sets the state of configuration logging. Values can be:<br>o Enabled - state changes will be logged. If logging is unavailable, the state change will still be permitted. o Disabled - state changes will not be logged.<br>o Mandatory - state change will be logged. If logging is unavailable, the state change will not be permitted.<br>When the state is set to Enabled or Mandatory, XenDesktop services will attempt to log operations (which perform configuration changes) before performing them. | false | false |  |
| Locale | Sets the language that logs should be recorded in. Values can be: 'en', 'ja', 'zh-CN', 'de', 'es' or 'fr'. | false | false |  |
| PassThru | Returns the affected record. By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output. | false | false | False |
| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high-level operation this cmdlet call forms a part of. Citrix Studio and Director typically create high-level operations. PowerShell scripts can also wrap a series of cmdlet calls in a high-level operation by way of the Start-LogHighLevelOperation and Stop-LogHighLevelOperation cmdlets. | false | false |  |
| BearerToken | Specifies the bearer token assigned to the calling user | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller the PowerShell snap-in will connect to. You can provide this as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | Localhost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value becomes the default. |
