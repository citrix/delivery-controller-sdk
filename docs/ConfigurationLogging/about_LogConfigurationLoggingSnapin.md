## Short Description

The Configuration Logging Service PowerShell snap-in provides administrative functions for the Configuration Logging Service.


## Command Prefix
All commands in this snap-in have the noun prefixed with 'Log'.


## Long Description
The Configuration Logging Service PowerShell snap-in enables both local and remote administration of the Configuration Logging Service.

The Configuration Logging Service logs configuration changes or administrator requested state changes made to the site. Configuration Logging can be configured, site wide, to be mandatory or optional. If mandatory logging is selected, then any attempts to change site configuration or state when the logging mechanism is unavailable are denied.

The Configuration Logging Service stores information about the logged changes in a database which can be configured to be separate from the site database.

The snap-in provides storage and configuration of these entities:

Site The Configuration Logging Site object holds global settings which control the behaviour of the Configuration Logging Service. The site object can be configured by the Set-LogSite cmdlet. The properties of the site object are returned by the Get-LogSite cmdlet.

High Level Operations A high level operation object represents a logged configuration change performed from Desktop Studio, Desktop Director or a PowerShell Script.

The XenDesktop consoles log high level operations when:


  1)  Executing operations which performs configuration changes.
  2)  Executing operations which performs administration related activities which may affect site configuration.
PowerShell scripts which carry out customized configuration changes can also log high level operations via cmdlets Start-LogHighLevelOperation and Stop-LogHighLevelOperation.
Low Level Operations A low level operation object represents a logged configuration change performed by a service. One or more low level operation objects are used to record the actions performed by a services in order to fulfil a high level operation initiated from the consoles, or from PowerShell scripts.
Low level operations in the system are returned by cmdlet Get-LogLowLevelOperation.
Operation Details A low level operation performed by a service can affect a number of individual objects, or a number of properties on an object. An operation detail log records each individual change to an object. This includes the creation and deletion of the object, as well as changes to individual properties of the object.
One or more operation detail objects are used to record specific changes to each object that is affected by a low level service operation.
Operation details are included in the data returned from the Get-LogLowLevelOperation cmdlet.
High Level Operations, Low Level Operations and Operation Details are arranged in a hierarchy. A High Level Operation can have multiple Low Level Operations, and each Low Level Operation can have multiple Operation Details.
Setting up a separate logging database -------------------------------------- After creating the database on the database server, the logging database can be setup and configured for use by:

  1)  Generating the database schema, and applying it the logging database
  2)  Configuring the configuration logging service to use the new logging database.
The logging database schema can be generated from the Get-LogDBSchem cmdlet, as illustrated below: Get-LogDBSchema -DatabaseName "loggingDB" -ServiceGroupName "service group name" -ScriptType Database -LocalDatabase:\$LocalDB -DataStore Logging
The configuration logging service can be configured to use the logging database with the Set-LogDBConnection cmdlet, as illustrated below: Set-LogDBConnection -DataStore Logging -DBConnection \$null Set-LogDBConnection -DataStore Logging -DBConnection "new logging db connection string"


Configuration Logging site settings -----------------------------------

On the Site object:


  * The 'State' setting allows configuration logging to be disabled, enabled, or made mandatory.

  * The 'Locale' setting specifies the language in which configuration logging data text will be stored.

See Get-LogSite cmdlet help for further information on these settings.

This locale setting applies to the text description that is associated with each log , e.g. ‘Create Catalog’. It  doesn't apply to other textual information in the log like the names of parameters passed to operations, e.g. ‘CatalogName’.

This localisation is applied when the data is logged, and not when the logs are viewed later. For example, logs which are created in English will be displayed in English on an end user system which may be configured with a different locale.
