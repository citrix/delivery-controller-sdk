# Add-Adminpermission
Add permissions to the set of permissions of a role.
## Syntax
```
Add-AdminPermission [-InputObject] <Permission[]> -Role <String> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Add-AdminPermission [-Permission] <String[]> -Role <String> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
Add extra permissions to the set of permissions that a role maps to.

Any administrator with a right including that role immediately gains the ability to use the operations of the new permissions.

Duplicate permissions do not produce an error, and permissions are skipped if the role already contains the permission (without error).

You cannot modify the permissions of built-in roles.
