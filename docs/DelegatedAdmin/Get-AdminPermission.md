Gets permissions configured for the site.
## Syntax
```
Get-AdminPermission [[-Name] <String>] [-Id <String>] [-Description <String>] [-GroupId <String>] [-GroupName <String>] [-Metadata <String>] [-Operation <String>] [-ReadOnly <Boolean>] [-Property <String[]>] [-ReturnTotalRecordCount] [-MaxRecordCount <Int32>] [-Skip <Int32>] [-SortBy <String>] [-Filter <String>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

## Detailed Description
Retrieves permission matching the specified criteria. If no parameters are specified this cmdlet enumerates all permissions.

Permissions are configured using the Import-AdminRoleConfiguration command, and are used to represent collections of operations that are needed to perform a particular task. These permissions are presented in Citrix Studio when configuring roles.

Permissions can also have metadata associated with them.

See about\_Admin\_Filtering for information about advanced filtering options.

| Operation | Gets permissions that contain a specific operation. | false | false |  |
| ReadOnly | Gets permissions with the specified value for the ReadOnly flag. | false | false |  |

| Skip | Skips the specified number of records before returning results. Also reduces the count returned by -ReturnTotalRecordCount. | false | false | 0 |
| SortBy | Sorts the results by the specified list of properties. The list is a set of property names separated by commas, semi-colons, or spaces. Optionally, prefix each name with a + or - to indicate ascending or descending order. Ascending order is assumed if no prefix is present. | false | false | The default sort order is by name or unique identifier. |
| Filter | Gets records that match a PowerShell-style filter expression. See about\_Admin\_Filtering for details. | false | false |  |
| BearerToken | Specifies the bearer token assigned to the calling user | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller the PowerShell snap-in will connect to. You can provide this as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | Localhost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value becomes the default. |
