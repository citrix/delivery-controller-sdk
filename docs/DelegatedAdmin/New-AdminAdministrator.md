# New-Adminadministrator
Adds a new administrator to the site.
## Syntax
```
New-AdminAdministrator [-Name] <String> [-Enabled <Boolean>] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

New-AdminAdministrator -Sid <String> [-Enabled <Boolean>] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
New-AdminAdministrator creates a new administrator object in the site. Once a new administrator has been created you can assign rights (role and scope pairs) to the administrator.

Administrator objects are used to determine what rights, and therefore what permissions a particular Active Directory user has through the various SDKs and consoles of the site.

When the Enabled flag of an administrator is set to false, any rights of the administrator are ignored by the system when performing permission checks.
