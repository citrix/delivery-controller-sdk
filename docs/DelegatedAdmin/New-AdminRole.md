# New-Adminrole
Adds a new custom role to the site.
## Syntax
```
New-AdminRole [-Name] <String> [-Description <String>] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
New-AdminRole adds a new custom role object to the site. Once a new role has been created, you can add permissions to the role which define what operations the role conveys.

Roles represent a job function, such as 'help desk administrator', and contain a list of permissions that are required to perform that job function.

To assign a role to an administrator, you combine it with a scope which indicates what objects the role can operate on. This pair (also known as a 'right') can then be assigned to an administrator. See Add-AdminRight for further details.

The identifier of the new role is chosen automatically, and custom roles created with this cmdlet always have their BuiltIn flag set to false.

You cannot modify built-in roles, and only some license editions support custom roles.
