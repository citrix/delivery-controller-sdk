# New-Adminscope
Adds a new scope to the site.
## Syntax
```
New-AdminScope [-Name] <String> [-Description <String>] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
New-AdminScope adds a new scope object to the site.

A scope represents a collection of objects. Scopes are used to group objects in a way that is relevant to the organization; for example, the set of delivery groups used by the Sales team.

You can create objects in particular scopes by specifying the -Scope parameter of a New- cmdlet for an object that can be scoped. You can then modify the contents of a scope with Add-&lt;Noun&gt;Scope and Remove-&lt;Noun&gt;Scope cmdlets from the correpsonding PowerShell snap-ins.

To assign a scope to an administrator, combine it with a role and then assign this pair (also known as a 'right') to an administrator. See Add-AdminRight for further details.

The identifier of the new scope is chosen automatically.
