# Remove-Adminpermission
Remove permissions from the set of permissions of a role.
## Syntax
```
Remove-AdminPermission [-InputObject] <Permission[]> -Role <String> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Remove-AdminPermission [-Permission] <String[]> -Role <String> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Remove-AdminPermission -All -Role <String> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
Remove permissions from the set of permissions that a role maps to.

Any administrator with a right including that role immediately loses the ability to use the operations of the removed permissions.

Duplicate permissions do not produce an error, and permissions that the roles does not already have are skipped (without error).

You cannot modify the permissions of built-in roles.
