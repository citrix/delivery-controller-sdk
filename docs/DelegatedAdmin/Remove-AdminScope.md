# Remove-Adminscope
Removes a scope from the site.
## Syntax
```
Remove-AdminScope [-InputObject] <Scope[]> [-Force] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Remove-AdminScope [-Id] <Guid[]> [-Force] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Remove-AdminScope [-Name] <String[]> [-Force] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
The Remove-AdminScope cmdlet deletes scopes from the site.

You cannot remove the built-in 'All' scope.

An error will be produced if the scope being removed is currently assigned to an administrator unless you specify the -Force option. When -Force is specified, any rights that reference the scope are also removed.
