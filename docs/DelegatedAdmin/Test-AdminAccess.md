# Test-Adminaccess
Retrieves the scopes where the specified operation is permitted.
## Syntax
```
Test-AdminAccess [-Operation] <String[]> [-Annotate] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
This cmdlet evaluates what rights the current user has, and from these determines the scopes where the specified operation is permitted.

Operations are the indivisible unit of functionality that each XenDesktop service can perform, and usually correspond to individual cmdlets.

If you specify the -Annotate option or specify multiple operations to check, the resulting object is annotated with the operation the result relates to.
