# Get-Hypconnectionregion
Enumerates the regions of a hypervisor connection that are based on cloud technology.
## Syntax
```
Get-HypConnectionRegion [-LiteralPath] <String> [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
Use this command to enumerate the available regions within a public or private cloud, when making hypervisor connections to cloud services. Sometimes, regions need to be selected and applied before the cloud connection can be used in a meaningful way. This cmdlet allows the supported regions to be listed so that one may be selected.

Once a region has been chosen, use the standard Set-Item provider cmdlet to select it. See the examples for further details.

This cmdlet may return no output, in which case the cloud connection can be considered "regionless" (or, implicitly, all within a single region). In such cases, there is no need to select a region, and the hypervisor connection can be used as is.

## Parameters
| Name   | Description | Required? | Pipeline Input | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LiteralPath | Specifies the path to the hypervisor connection whose regions are being examined. This cmdlet is valid only for hypervisor connections that have the UsesCloudInfrastructure flag set to true. The path must be in one of the following formats: &lt;drive&gt;:\\Connections\\&lt;ConnectionName&gt; or  &lt;drive&gt;:\\Connections\\{&lt;Connection Uid&gt;} | true | true (ByValue) |  |
| BearerToken | Specifies the bearer token assigned to the calling user | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller to which the PowerShell snap-in connects. You can provide a host name or an IP address. | false | false | LocalHost. When a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value becomes the default. |
