| ConnectionType | Specifies a filter for the cloud connection type, such as "AWS" or "CloudPlatform". | false | false |  |

Optionally, prefix each name with a + or - to indicate ascending or descending order. Ascending order is assumed if no prefix is present. | false | false | The default sort order is by name or unique identifier. |

| BearerToken | Specifies the bearer token assigned to the calling user | false | false |  |
