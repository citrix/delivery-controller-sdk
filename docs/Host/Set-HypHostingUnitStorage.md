## Parameters
| Name   | Description | Required? | Pipeline Input | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LiteralPath | Specifies the path to the hosting unit which defines the storage. The path must be in one of the following formats: &lt;drive&gt;:\\HostingUnits\\&lt;HostingUnitName&gt; or  &lt;drive&gt;:\\HostingUnits\\{&lt;HostingUnit Uid&gt;} | true | false |  |
| StoragePath | Specifies the path to the storage that will be modified. The path must be in one of the following formats: &lt;drive&gt;:\\Connections\\&lt;ConnectionName&gt;\\MyStorage.storage or  &lt;drive&gt;:\\Connections\\{&lt;Connection Uid&gt;}\\MyStorage.storage or  &lt;drive&gt;:\\HostingUnits\\&lt;HostingUnitName&gt;\\MyStorage.storage or  &lt;drive&gt;:\\HostingUnits\\{&lt;hostingUnit Uid&gt;}\\MyStorage.storage | true | true (ByValue) |  |
| StorageType | Specifies the type of storage in StoragePath. Supported storage types are: OSStorage PersonalvDiskStorage TemporaryStorage | false | false | OSStorage |
| Superseded | Specifies that this storage has been superseded and must not be used for future provisioning operations. Existing virtual machines using this storage will continue to function. | false | false |  |
| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high-level operation this cmdlet call forms a part of. Citrix Studio and Director typically create high-level operations. PowerShell scripts can also wrap a series of cmdlet calls in a high-level operation by way of the Start-LogHighLevelOperation and Stop-LogHighLevelOperation cmdlets. | false | false |  |
| BearerToken | Specifies the bearer token assigned to the calling user | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller that the PowerShell snap-in connects. This can be a host name or an IP address. | false | false | LocalHost. When a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value becomes the default. |

## Input Type

## Return Values

### Citrix.Xdpowershell.Hostingunit
Set-HypHostingUnitStorage returns an object containing the new definition of the hosting unit.<br>    HostingUnitUid &lt;Guid&gt;<br>        Specifies the unique identifier for the hosting unit.<br>    HostingUnitName &lt;string&gt;<br>        Specifies the name of the hosting unit.<br>    HypervisorConnection &lt;Citrix.XDPowerShell.HypervisorConnection&gt;<br>        Specifies the connection that the hosting unit uses to access a hypervisor.<br>    RootId &lt;string&gt;<br>        Identifies, to the hypervisor, the root of the hosting unit.<br>    RootPath &lt;string&gt;<br>        The hosting unit provider path that represents the root of the hosting unit.<br>    Storage &lt;Citrix.XDPowerShell.Storage\[\]&gt;<br>        The list of storage items that the hosting unit can use.<br>    PersonalvDiskStorage &lt;Citrix.XDPowerShell.Storage\[\]&gt;<br>        The list of storage items that the hosting unit can use for storing personal data.<br>    VMTaggingEnabled &lt;Boolean&gt;<br>        Specifies whether or not the metadata in the hypervisor can be used to store information about the XenDesktop Machine Creation Service.<br>    NetworkId &lt;string&gt;<br>        The hypervisor's internal identifier that represents the network specified for the hosting unit.<br>    NetworkPath &lt;string&gt;<br>        The hosting unit provider path to the network specified for the hosting unit.<br>    AdditionalStorage<br>        The list of additional storage items that the hosting unit can use.<br>    Metadata &lt;Citrix.XDPowerShell.Metadata\[\]&gt;<br>        A list of key value pairs that can store additional information about the hosting unit.
## Notes
The storage path must be valid for the hosting unit. The rules that are applied are as follows: XenServer (HypervisorConnection Type = XenServer)<br>    NA<br>    VMWare vSphere/ESX (HypervisorConnection Type = vCenter)<br>    The storage path must be directly contained in the root path item of the hosting unit.<br>    Microsoft SCVMM/Hyper-v (HypervisorConnection Type = SCVMM)<br>    Only one storage entry for these connection types is valid, and it must reference an SMB share. Additionally, if a Hyper-V failover cluster is used the SMB share must be the top-level mount point of the cluster shared volume on one of the servers in the cluster (i.e. C:\\ClusterStorage).<br>    In the case of failure, the following errors can be produced.<br>    Error Codes<br>    -----------<br>    HostingUnitsPathInvalid<br>    The path provided is not to an item in a subdirectory of a hosting unit item.<br>    HostingUnitStoragePathInvalid<br>    The specified path is invalid.<br>    HostingUnitStoragePathInvalid<br>    The storage path cannot be found or is invalid. See notes above about validity.<br>    HostingUnitStorageDuplicateObjectExists<br>    The specified storage path is already part of the hosting unit.<br>    HypervisorInMaintenanceMode<br>    The hypervisor for the connection is in maintenance mode.<br>    DatabaseError<br>    An error occurred in the service while attempting a database operation.<br>    DatabaseNotConfigured<br>    The operation could not be completed because the database for the service is not configured.<br>    DataStoreException<br>    An error occurred in the service while attempting a database operation. Communication with the database failed for<br>    for various reasons.<br>    CommunicationError<br>    An error occurred while communicating with the service.<br>    PermissionDenied<br>    The user does not have administrative rights to perform this operation.<br>    ExceptionThrown<br>    An unexpected error occurred. To locate more details, see the Windows event logs on the controller being used, or examine the XenDesktop logs.
