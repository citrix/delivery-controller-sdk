# Set-Hypvolumeserviceconfiguration
Applies a change to one of the VolumeServiceConfiguration instances in the site.
## Syntax
```
Set-HypVolumeServiceConfiguration -VolumeWorkerPackageUri <String> -ConnectionType <String> -VolumeServiceConfigurationName <String> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Set-HypVolumeServiceConfiguration -RegionName <String> -BaseLinuxTemplateId <String> -ConnectionType <String> -VolumeServiceConfigurationName <String> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
Volume service configurations are used to control how cloud-based host connections behave when provisioning machines. They contain two pieces of information. The first is a per-region specification of the cloud template that provides the standard Linux operating system for the cloud. The second is the specification of a URL from which the Citrix Volume Worker software can be installed (not all cloud connections make use of this URL, but they all make use of the template map).

Each cmdlet invocation can be used to either change the volume worker URL, or to modify (or add) an entry in the Linux template map. These two operations are supported by parameter sets. To change both properties, you must invoke the cmdlet twice.

## Parameters
| Name   | Description | Required? | Pipeline Input | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ConnectionType | Specifies the cloud connection type, such as "AWS" or "CloudPlatform". | true | false |  |
| VolumeServiceConfigurationName | Specifies the name of the configuration you want to modify. This parameter is used alongside the ConnectionType to specify a single configuration set unambiguously. There can be only one named configuration per connection type. In a newly-configured site, there will be exactly one configuration set called "SiteDefault" for each of CloudPlatform and AWS. | true | false |  |
| VolumeWorkerPackageUri | Specifies a (new) URI for the volume worker package. | true | false |  |
| RegionName | Specifies the cloud region in which the Linux template resides. This parameter is used only when passing the BaseLinuxTemplateId parameter. The format of the string is cloud-specific. For example, for an AWS-based cloud, it would be a region identifier such as "us-east-1". | true | false |  |
| BaseLinuxTemplateId | Specifies a change to the standard Linux template that should be used in the cloud. When passing this parameter, you must also specify the RegionName parameter to indicate the region in which this template resides. The format of the string is cloud-specific. For example, for an AWS-based cloud, it would be an AMI identifier such as "ami-1234abcd". | true | false |  |
| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high-level operation this cmdlet call forms a part of. Citrix Studio and Director typically create high-level operations. PowerShell scripts can also wrap a series of cmdlet calls in a high-level operation by way of the Start-LogHighLevelOperation and Stop-LogHighLevelOperation cmdlets. | false | false |  |
| BearerToken | Specifies the bearer token assigned to the calling user | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller the PowerShell snap-in will connect to. You can provide this as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | Localhost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value becomes the default. |
