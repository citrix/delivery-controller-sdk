# Add-HypHostingUnitNetwork

   Makes additional hypervisor networks available for use in a HostingUnit.

## Syntax
```
Add-HypHostingUnitNetwork [-LiteralPath] <String> [-NetworkPath] <String> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## Detailed Description
   Use this command to extend the set of hypervisor networks that are made available through the HostingUnit to the Citrix Machine Creation Service. When new machines are created, their virtual NICs can be associated only with networks that are in this set. This command cannot be used if the connection for the hosting unit is in maintenance mode.

## Parameters

| Name   | Description | Required? | Pipeline Input | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LiteralPath | Specifies the path to the hosting unit to which the network will be added. The path must be in one of the following formats: <drive>:\HostingUnits\<HostingUnitName> or  <drive>:\HostingUnits\{<HostingUnit Uid>} | true | false |  |
| NetworkPath | Specifies the path to the network that will be added. The path must be in one of the following formats: <drive>:\Connections\<ConnectionName>\MyNetwork.network or  <drive>:\Connections\{<Connection Uid>}\MyNetwork.network or  <drive>:\HostingUnits\<HostingUnitName>\MyNetwork.network or  <drive>:\HostingUnits\{<hostingUnit Uid>}\MyNetwork.network | true | true (ByValue) |  |
| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high-level operation this cmdlet call forms a part of. Citrix Studio and Director typically create high-level operations. PowerShell scripts can also wrap a series of cmdlet calls in a high-level operation by way of the Start-LogHighLevelOperation and Stop-LogHighLevelOperation cmdlets. | false | false |  |
| BearerToken | Specifies the bearer token assigned to the calling user | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller to which the PowerShell snap-in connects. This can be a host name or an IP address. | false | false | LocalHost. When a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value becomes the default. |

   ## Notes
   The network path must be valid for the hosting unit. The rules that are applied are as follows: XenServer (HypervisorConnection Type = XenServer)<br>    NA<br>    VMWare vSphere/ESX (HypervisorConnection Type = vCenter)<br>    The network path must be directly contained in the root path item of the hosting unit.<br>    Microsoft SCVMM/Hyper-v (HypervisorConnection Type = SCVMM)<br>    NA<br>    In the case of failure, the following errors can result.<br>    Error Codes<br>    -----------<br>    HostingUnitsPathInvalid<br>    The path provided is not to an item in a subdirectory of a hosting unit item.<br>    HostingUnitNetworkPathInvalid<br>    The specified path is invalid.<br>    HostingUnitNetworkPathInvalid<br>    The network path cannot be found or is invalid. See notes above about validity.<br>    HostingUnitNetworkDuplicateObjectExists<br>    The specified network path is already part of the hosting unit.<br>    HypervisorInMaintenanceMode<br>    The hypervisor for the connection is in maintenance mode.<br>    DatabaseError<br>    An error occurred in the service while attempting a database operation.<br>    DatabaseNotConfigured<br>    The operation could not be completed because the database for the service is not configured.<br>    DataStoreException<br>    An error occurred in the service while attempting a database operation.
