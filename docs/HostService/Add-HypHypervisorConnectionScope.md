# Add-HypHypervisorConnectionScope

   Add the specified HypervisorConnection(s) to the given scope(s).

## Syntax
```
Add-HypHypervisorConnectionScope [-Scope] <String[]> -InputObject <HypervisorConnection[]> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Add-HypHypervisorConnectionScope [-Scope] <String[]> -HypervisorConnectionUid <Guid[]> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Add-HypHypervisorConnectionScope [-Scope] <String[]> -HypervisorConnectionName <String[]> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## Detailed Description
   The Add-HypHypervisorConnectionScope command is used to associate one or more HypervisorConnection objects with given scope(s).

There are multiple parameter sets for this cmdlet, allowing you to identify the HypervisorConnection objects in different ways: 
 - HypervisorConnection objects can be piped in or specified by the InputObject parameter 
 - The HypervisorConnectionUid parameter specifies objects by HypervisorConnectionUid 
 - The HypervisorConnectionName parameter specifies objects by HypervisorConnectionName (supports wildcards)

To add a HypervisorConnection to a scope you need permission to change the scopes of the HypervisorConnection and permission to add objects to all of the scopes you have specified.

If the HypervisorConnection is already in a scope, that scope will be silently ignored.
