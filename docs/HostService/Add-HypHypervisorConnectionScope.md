# Add-HypHypervisorConnectionScope

   Add the specified HypervisorConnection(s) to the given scope(s).

## Syntax
```
Add-HypHypervisorConnectionScope [-Scope] <String[]> -InputObject <HypervisorConnection[]> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Add-HypHypervisorConnectionScope [-Scope] <String[]> -HypervisorConnectionUid <Guid[]> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Add-HypHypervisorConnectionScope [-Scope] <String[]> -HypervisorConnectionName <String[]> [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## Detailed Description
   The Add-HypHypervisorConnectionScope command is used to associate one or more HypervisorConnection objects with given scope(s).

There are multiple parameter sets for this cmdlet, allowing you to identify the HypervisorConnection objects in different ways: 
 - HypervisorConnection objects can be piped in or specified by the InputObject parameter 
 - The HypervisorConnectionUid parameter specifies objects by HypervisorConnectionUid 
 - The HypervisorConnectionName parameter specifies objects by HypervisorConnectionName (supports wildcards)

To add a HypervisorConnection to a scope you need permission to change the scopes of the HypervisorConnection and permission to add objects to all of the scopes you have specified.

If the HypervisorConnection is already in a scope, that scope will be silently ignored.

| Name   | Description | Required? | Pipeline Input | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Scope | Specifies the scopes to add the objects to. | true | false |  |
| InputObject | Specifies the HypervisorConnection objects to be added. | true | true (ByValue, ByPropertyName) |  |
| HypervisorConnectionUid | Specifies the HypervisorConnection objects to be added by HypervisorConnectionUid. | true | true (ByValue, ByPropertyName) |  |
| HypervisorConnectionName | Specifies the HypervisorConnection objects to be added by HypervisorConnectionName. | true | true (ByValue, ByPropertyName) |  |
| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high-level operation this cmdlet call forms a part of. Citrix Studio and Director typically create high-level operations. PowerShell scripts can also wrap a series of cmdlet calls in a high-level operation by way of the Start-LogHighLevelOperation and Stop-LogHighLevelOperation cmdlets. | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller the PowerShell snap-in will connect to. You can provide this as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | Localhost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value becomes the default. |
