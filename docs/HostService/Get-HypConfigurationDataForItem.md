# Get-HypConfigurationDataForItem

   Retrieves the configuration data for an item in the Host Service provider path.  Note: For this release, only VM items are supported for this operation.

## Syntax
```
Get-HypConfigurationDataForItem [-LiteralPath] <String> [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## Detailed Description
   This command provides a mechanism for retrieving extra data about an entry in the hosting unit service provider.  The referenced item must be contained within the connections directory in the provider (i.e. XDHyp:\Connections).

This mechanism is used for obtaining data that is not required frequently and/or has a high overhead associated with its retrieval (so as to maintain the responsiveness of the provider). For this release of the PowerShell snap-in, the only provider items that can be used with this operation are VM items.  For a VM, this provides a mechanism to obtain the number of CPUs, the amount of Memory (in MB) and hard disk drive capacity (in GB).

## Parameters

| Name   | Description | Required? | Pipeline Input | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LiteralPath | Specifies the path within a hosting unit provider to the item for which configuration data is to be retrieved. The path specified must be in one of the following formats; <drive>:\Connections\<Connection Name>\<Item Path of VM object> or  <drive>:\Connections\{<connection Uid>\<Item Path of VM object>} or <drive>:\HostingUnits\<HostingUnit Name>\<Item Path of VM object> or  <drive>:\HostingUnits\{<hostingUnit Uid>\<Item Path of VM object>} | true | true (ByValue) |  |
| BearerToken | Specifies the bearer token assigned to the calling user | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller that the PowerShell snap-in connects to.  You can provide this as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | LocalHost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value becomes the default. |

## Input Type
### System.string<br>    You can pipe a string that contains a path to Get-HypConfigurationDataForItem
   
## Return Values
### PSObject<br>    Get-HypConfigurationDataForItem returns a PSObject containing the properties that are appropriate for the item specified by the path.<br>    Properties for VM Item<br>    ----------------------<br>    CPUCount <int><br>        Specifies the number of CPUs assigned to the VM.<br>    MemoryMB <int><br>        The amount of memory allocated to the VM.<br>    HardDiskSizeGB <int><br>        The capacity of the primary hard drive assigned to the VM.
   ## Notes
   For this release, this cmdlet provides only configuration data for VM objects in the provider.  Using a path to an item that is not a VM results in a error.<br>    In the case of failure the following errors can result.<br>    Error Codes<br>    -----------<br>    InputHypervisorItemPathInvalid<br>    The path provided is not to an item in a sub-directory of a connection item or a hosting unit item.<br>    InvalidHypervisorItemPath<br>    No item exists with the specified path.<br>    InvalidHypervisorItem<br>    The item specified by the path exists, but is not a VM Item.<br>    DatabaseError<br>    An error occurred in the service while attempting a database operation.<br>    DatabaseNotConfigured<br>    The operation could not be completed because the database for the service is not configured.<br>    DataStoreException<br>    An error occurred in the service while attempting a database operation - communication with the database failed for<br>    various reasons.<br>    CommunicationError<br>    An error occurred while communicating with the service.<br>    InvalidFilter<br>    A filtering expression was supplied that could not be interpreted for this cmdlet.<br>    HypervisorPermissionDenied<br>    The hypervisor login used does not provide authorization to access the data for this item.<br>    ExceptionThrown<br>    An unexpected error occurred.
