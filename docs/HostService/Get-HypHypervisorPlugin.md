   ## Notes
   To use third-party plug-ins, the plug-in assemblies must be installed into the appropriate location on each controller machine that forms part of the Citrix controller site.  Failure to do this can result in unpredictable behavior, especially during service failover conditions.<br>    In the case of failure the following errors can result.<br>    Error Codes<br>    -----------<br>    DatabaseError<br>    An error occurred in the service while attempting a database operation.<br>    CommunicationError<br>    An error occurred while communicating with the service.<br>    InvalidFilter<br>    A filtering expression was supplied that could not be interpreted for this cmdlet.<br>    ExceptionThrown<br>    An unexpected error occurred.  To locate more details, see the Windows event logs on the controller being used or examine the XenDesktop logs.
