## Examples

### EXAMPLE 1
```
c:\PS>Get-HypLocalizedString -LiteralPath XDHyp:\Connections\MyCloud -Category Exception -Locale "en-US" -LookupKey "MyCloud.InsufficientFreeIpSpace"

          Category             : Exception
          LookupKey            : MyCloud.InsufficientFreeIpSpace
          DisplayText          : There are not enough free IP addresses on the network {0}
```
   Description<br>-----------<br>This command illustrates how a single error/exception message can be obtained for a hosting operation that failed (such as a provisioning operation). The caller specifies that they need to display the message in the en-US locale. They also specify a lookup key or message ID for the message, which will have been obtained as an exception code from the failed operation. The locale and key/ID are traded for a readable message, which also includes substitutions.
