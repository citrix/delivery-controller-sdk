| LiteralPath | Specifies the path within a hosting unit provider to the virtual machine item for which to create a new snapshot. The path specified must be in one of the following formats: <drive>:\Connections\<Connection Name>\<Item Path of VM object> or  <drive>:\Connections\{<connection Uid>\<Item Path of VM object>} or <drive>:\HostingUnits\<HostingUnit Name>\<Item Path of VM object> or  <drive>:\HostingUnits\{<hostingUnit Uid>\<Item Path of VM object>} | true | true (ByValue) |  |
| SnapshotName | The name of the new snapshot. This is visible in the hypervisor management console. | true | false |  |
| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high-level operation this cmdlet call forms a part of. Citrix Studio and Director typically create high-level operations.

| BearerToken | Specifies the bearer token assigned to the calling user | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller that the PowerShell snap-in connects to.  You can provide this as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | LocalHost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value becomes the default. |
| SnapshotDescription | The description to add to the snapshot. This is visible in the hypervisor management console. | false | false |  |
