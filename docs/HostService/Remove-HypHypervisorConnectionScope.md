## Detailed Description
   The Remove-HypHypervisorConnectionScope command is used to remove one or more HypervisorConnection objects from the given scope(s).

There are multiple parameter sets for this cmdlet, allowing you to identify the HypervisorConnection objects in different ways: 
 - HypervisorConnection objects can be piped in or specified by the InputObject parameter 
 - The HypervisorConnectionUid parameter specifies objects by HypervisorConnectionUid 
 - The HypervisorConnectionName parameter specifies objects by HypervisorConnectionName (supports wildcards)

To remove a HypervisorConnection from a scope you need permission to change the scopes of the HypervisorConnection.

If the HypervisorConnection is not in a specified scope, that scope will be silently ignored.
