# Set-HypAdminConnection

   Set the controller to be used by the cmdlets that form the Host service PowerShell snap-in.

## Syntax
```
Set-HypAdminConnection [-AdminAddress <String>] [-BearerToken <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## Detailed Description
   Use this command to set the default controller address to be used by the cmdlets to communicate with the controller.  Most Host service cmdlets take an 'AdminAddress' parameter that can be used to define the controller (when used, this overrides this setting). However, the Set-Location cmdlet in the Host service provider does not offer this option. Therefore, the controller address must be set using this cmdlet, if no other cmdlets have set the address previously in the current runspace.
