## Parameters

| Name   | Description | Required? | Pipeline Input | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LiteralPath | Specifies the path to the hosting unit which defines the storage. The path must be in one of the following formats: <drive>:\HostingUnits\<HostingUnitName> or  <drive>:\HostingUnits\{<HostingUnit Uid>} | true | false |  |
| StoragePath | Specifies the path to the storage that will be modified. The path must be in one of the following formats: <drive>:\Connections\<ConnectionName>\MyStorage.storage or  <drive>:\Connections\{<Connection Uid>}\MyStorage.storage or  <drive>:\HostingUnits\<HostingUnitName>\MyStorage.storage or  <drive>:\HostingUnits\{<hostingUnit Uid>}\MyStorage.storage | true | true (ByValue) |  |
| StorageType | Specifies the type of storage in StoragePath. Supported storage types are: OSStorage PersonalvDiskStorage TemporaryStorage | false | false | OSStorage |
| Superseded | Specifies that this storage has been superseded and must not be used for future provisioning operations. Existing virtual machines using this storage will continue to function. | false | false |  |
| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high-level operation this cmdlet call forms a part of. Citrix Studio and Director typically create high-level operations. PowerShell scripts can also wrap a series of cmdlet calls in a high-level operation by way of the Start-LogHighLevelOperation and Stop-LogHighLevelOperation cmdlets. | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller that the PowerShell snap-in connects. This can be a host name or an IP address. | false | false | LocalHost. When a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value becomes the default. |

## Input Type
### System.string<br>    You can pipe a string that contains a path to Add-HypHostingUnitStorage (StoragePath parameter).
   
## Return Values
### Citrix.XDPowerShell.HostingUnit<br>    Set-HypHostingUnitStorage returns an object containing the new definition of the hosting unit.<br>    HostingUnitUid <Guid><br>        Specifies the unique identifier for the hosting unit.<br>    HostingUnitName <string><br>        Specifies the name of the hosting unit.<br>    HypervisorConnection <Citrix.XDPowerShell.HypervisorConnection><br>        Specifies the connection that the hosting unit uses to access a hypervisor.<br>    RootId <string><br>        Identifies, to the hypervisor, the root of the hosting unit.<br>    RootPath <string><br>        The hosting unit provider path that represents the root of the hosting unit.<br>    Storage <Citrix.XDPowerShell.Storage[]><br>        The list of storage items that the hosting unit can use.<br>    PersonalvDiskStorage <Citrix.XDPowerShell.Storage[]><br>        The list of storage items that the hosting unit can use for storing personal data.<br>    VMTaggingEnabled <Boolean><br>        Specifies whether or not the metadata in the hypervisor can be used to store information about the XenDesktop Machine Creation Service.<br>    NetworkId <string><br>        The hypervisor's internal identifier that represents the network specified for the hosting unit.<br>    NetworkPath <string><br>        The hosting unit provider path to the network specified for the hosting unit.<br>    AdditionalStorage<br>        The list of additional storage items that the hosting unit can use.<br>    Metadata <Citrix.XDPowerShell.Metadata[]><br>        A list of key value pairs that can store additional information about the hosting unit.
   ## Notes
   The storage path must be valid for the hosting unit. The rules that are applied are as follows: XenServer (HypervisorConnection Type = XenServer)<br>    NA<br>    VMWare vSphere/ESX (HypervisorConnection Type = vCenter)<br>    The storage path must be directly contained in the root path item of the hosting unit.<br>    Microsoft SCVMM/Hyper-v (HypervisorConnection Type = SCVMM)<br>    Only one storage entry for these connection types is valid, and it must reference an SMB share. Additionally, if a Hyper-V failover cluster is used the SMB share must be the top-level mount point of the cluster shared volume on one of the servers in the cluster (i.e. C:\ClusterStorage).<br>    In the case of failure, the following errors can be produced.<br>    Error Codes<br>    -----------<br>    HostingUnitsPathInvalid<br>    The path provided is not to an item in a subdirectory of a hosting unit item.<br>    HostingUnitStoragePathInvalid<br>    The specified path is invalid.<br>    HostingUnitStoragePathInvalid<br>    The storage path cannot be found or is invalid. See notes above about validity.<br>    HostingUnitStorageDuplicateObjectExists<br>    The specified storage path is already part of the hosting unit.<br>    HypervisorInMaintenanceMode<br>    The hypervisor for the connection is in maintenance mode.<br>    DatabaseError<br>    An error occurred in the service while attempting a database operation.<br>    DatabaseNotConfigured<br>    The operation could not be completed because the database for the service is not configured.<br>    DataStoreException<br>    An error occurred in the service while attempting a database operation. Communication with the database failed for<br>    for various reasons.<br>    CommunicationError<br>    An error occurred while communicating with the service.<br>    PermissionDenied<br>    The user does not have administrative rights to perform this operation.<br>    ExceptionThrown<br>    An unexpected error occurred. To locate more details, see the Windows event logs on the controller being used, or examine the XenDesktop logs.
