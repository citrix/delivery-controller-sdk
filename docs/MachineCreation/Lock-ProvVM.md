# Lock-Provvm
Locks a VM.
## Syntax
```
Lock-ProvVM [-VMID] <String[]> -ProvisioningSchemeName <String> [-Tag <String>] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Lock-ProvVM [-VMID] <String[]> -ProvisioningSchemeUid <Guid> [-Tag <String>] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
Provides the ability to 'lock' a virtual machine with a tag string.  This stops other commands from being able to remove the virtual machine without unlocking the VM first.  This is to enable consumers of the virtual machines to indicate that the VM is being used.

| VMID | The virtual machine Id (hypervisor context). | true | true (ByPropertyName) |  |
| ProvisioningSchemeName | The name of the provisioning scheme. | true | true (ByPropertyName) |  |
| ProvisioningSchemeUid | The unique identifier of the provisioning scheme. | true | false |  |
| Tag | The string to be held against the VM being locked. | false | false |  |
| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high-level operation this cmdlet call forms a part of. Citrix Studio and Director typically create high-level operations.

| BearerToken | Specifies the bearer token assigned to the calling user | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller that the PowerShell snap-in connects to.  You can provide this as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | LocalHost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value becomes the default. |
