## Detailed Description
Lets you create a new provisioning scheme. The creation process makes a copy of the hard disk attached to a virtual machine snapshot or VM template and stores it in every storage location that the hosting unit referenced by the provisioning scheme defines. This is a long-running task and typically takes several minutes to complete (depending on the size of the hard disk that is being copied and the number of snapshots that the hard disk consists of).

A snapshot or VM template must be used rather than a VM, so that the content of the hard disk for the provisioning scheme can be easily determined.

Because the snapshot or VM template are specified using a path into the Citrix Host Service PowerShell Provider, the Citrix Host Service PowerShell snap-in must also be loaded for this cmdlet to be used.

This cmdlet requires information to be provided that is retrieved using other snap-ins that form part of the Citrix Machine Creation Services: Hosting Unit Service Snapin The snap-in that provides information about the hypervisors. AD Identity Service Snapin The snap-in that provides information about the identity pools.

The provisioning scheme is a collection of all of the data that is required to form a template against which virtual machines can be created.  It therefore requires the following: Hosting Unit A reference to an item defined in the Host Service that defines the hypervisor, the network, and the storage to be used. Identity Pool A reference to the collection of Active Directory accounts that is used for virtual machines created from the provisioning scheme.

## Parameters
| Name   | Description | Required? | Pipeline Input | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ProvisioningSchemeName | The name of the provisioning scheme to be created.  This must be a name that is not being used by an existing provisioning scheme, and it must not contain any of the following characters \\/;:#.\*?=&lt;&gt;|\[\]()""' | true | false |  |
| HostingUnitName | The name of the hosting unit used for the provisioning scheme. | true | false |  |
| IdentityPoolName | The name for the identity pool used for the provisioning scheme. | true | false |  |
| MasterImageVM | The path in the hosting unit provider to the virtual machine snapshot or VM template that is used. This identifies the hard disk to be used and the default values for the memory and processors. This must be a path to a Snapshot or Template item in the same hosting unit that the hosting unit name or hosting unit UID refers to.<br>Valid paths are of the format; XDHyp:\\HostingUnits\\&lt;HostingUnitName&gt;\\&lt;path&gt;\\&lt;VMName&gt;.vm\\&lt;SnapshotName&gt;.snapshot XDHyp:\\HostingUnits\\&lt;HostingUnitName&gt;\\&lt;path&gt;\\&lt;TemplateName&gt;.template | true | true (ByPropertyName) |  |
| HostingUnitUid | The identifier for the hosting unit used for the provisioning scheme. | true | false |  |
| IdentityPoolUid | The identifier of the identity pool used for the provisioning scheme. | true | false |  |
| VMCpuCount | The number of processors used by virtual machines created from the provisioning scheme. | false | false | The number of CPUs assigned to the base image VM snapshot or VM template. |
| VMMemoryMB | The maximum amount of memory used by virtual machines created from the provisioning scheme. | false | false | The amount of memory assigned to the base image VM snapshot or VM template. |
| CleanOnBoot | Indicates whether or not the virtual machines created from this provisioning scheme are reset to their initial condition each time they are started. | false | false | false |
| UsePersonalVDiskStorage | Indicates whether or not personal vDisks are used for the VMs in this provisioning scheme. | false | false |  |
| UseWriteBackCache | Indicates whether or not write back cache is enabled for the VMs in this provisioning scheme. Use additional parameters to configure the write back cache. WriteBackCacheDiskSize: The size in GB of any temporary storage disk used by the write back cache. Should be used in conjunction with WriteBackCacheMemorySize. WriteBackCacheMemorySize: The size in MB of any write back cache if required. Should be used in conjunction with WriteBackCacheDiskSize. Setting RAM Cache to 0 but specifying Disk Cache effectively disables the RAM Cache. However, there will be some memory still used to allow the I/O Optimization to operate. | false | false |  |
| Scope | The administration scopes to be applied to the new provisioning scheme. | false | false |  |
| NoImagePreparation | Indicates that image preparation should not be performed on this provisioning scheme. | false | false |  |
| NetworkMapping | Specifies how the attached NICs are mapped to networks. If this parameter is omitted, provisioned VMs are created with a single NIC, which is mapped to the default network in the HostingUnit. If this parameter is supplied, machines are created with the number of NICs specified in the map, and each NIC is attached to the specified network. | false | false |  |
| Metadata | Specifies any metadata to be attached to the scheme when it is created. | false | false |  |
| ServiceOffering | The Service Offering to use when creating machines in Cloud Hypervisors. | false | false |  |
| SecurityGroup | The security groups to apply to machines created in Cloud Hypervisors. | false | false |  |
| DedicatedTenancy | Indicates whether to use dedicated tenancy when creating machines in Cloud Hypervisors. | false | false | false |
| VhdTemplateSource | A file path to a source VHD template to be used when performing application scanning during image preparation. The presence of this parameter in conjunction with VhdResultDestination implies that application scanning is to be performed. | false | false |  |
| VhdResultDestination | A file path (including file name) where the VHD disk file containing the results of application scanning should be written. | false | false |  |
| AppScanResultsFile | File name to which the results of application scanning should be written. | false | false |  |
| CustomProperties | The properties of the provisioning scheme that are specific to the target hosting infrastructure. | false | false |  |
| ResetAdministratorPasswords | Indicates whether to reset the password for the administrator accounts on provisioned machines. | false | false |  |
| FunctionalLevel | The FunctionalLevel of the VDA installed on the given MasterImageVM. | false | false |  |
| UseFullDiskCloneProvisioning | Indicates that the virtual machines created from the provisioning scheme should be created using the dedicated full disk clone feature. | false | false |  |
| RunAsynchronously | Indicates whether or not the command returns before it is complete. If specified, the command returns an identifier for the task that was created. This task can be monitored using the get-ProvTask command. | false | false | false |
| PurgeJobOnSuccess | Indicates that the task history is removed from the database when the task has finished. This can only be specified for tasks that are not run asynchronously. | false | false |  |
| InitialBatchSizeHint | Provides a predictive hint for the number of initial VMs that will be added to the MCS catalog when the scheme is succesfully created. Callers should supply this parameter in situations where the completion of New-ProvScheme will be closely followed by a New-ProvVM call to create an initial batch of VMs in the catalog. | false | false |  |
| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high-level operation this cmdlet call forms a part of. Citrix Studio and Director typically create high-level operations. PowerShell scripts can also wrap a series of cmdlet calls in a high-level operation by way of the Start-LogHighLevelOperation and Stop-LogHighLevelOperation cmdlets. | false | false |  |
| BearerToken | Specifies the bearer token assigned to the calling user | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller the PowerShell snap-in will connect to. You can provide this as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | Localhost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value becomes the default. |
