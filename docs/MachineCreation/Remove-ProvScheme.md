# Remove-Provscheme
Removes a provisioning scheme
## Syntax
```
Remove-ProvScheme [-ProvisioningSchemeName] <String> [-ForgetVM] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Remove-ProvScheme -ProvisioningSchemeUid <Guid> [-ForgetVM] [-LoggingId <Guid>] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
Provides the ability to remove a provisioning Scheme.  The provisioning scheme must not contain any VMs unless the 'ForgetVM' option is specified.

If 'ForgetVM' is not specified, a cmdlet task is created that runs in the background to remove the hard disk copies that have been created for the provisioning scheme in hypervisor storage.  Use the Get-ProvTask command to monitor the progress of this task.

## Parameters
| Name   | Description | Required? | Pipeline Input | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ProvisioningSchemeName | The name of the provisioning scheme to be removed. | true | true (ByPropertyName) |  |
| ProvisioningSchemeUid | The unique identifier for the provisioning scheme to be removed. | true | true (ByPropertyName) |  |
| ForgetVM | Indicates whether or not the VMs in the provisioning scheme should be left in the hypervisor and only the data held in the Machine Creation Services removed.  If this is specified, it is up to the administrator of the hypervisor to remove the VMs and hard disk images using the tools provided by the hypervisor itself. | false | false |  |
| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high-level operation this cmdlet call forms a part of. Citrix Studio and Director typically create high-level operations. PowerShell scripts can also wrap a series of cmdlet calls in a high-level operation by way of the Start-LogHighLevelOperation and Stop-LogHighLevelOperation cmdlets. | false | false |  |
| BearerToken | Specifies the bearer token assigned to the calling user | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller that the PowerShell snap-in connects to.  You can provide this as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | LocalHost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value becomes the default. |

## Notes
If the hosting unit referenced by the provisioning scheme no longer exists (i.e. it has been removed using the Hosting Unit PowerShell snap-in), the provisioning scheme data is deleted from the database without errors. However, the hard disks associated with the provisioning scheme cannot be removed and remain in the hypervisor.<br>    In the case of failure, the following errors can result.<br>    Error Codes<br>    -----------<br>    IllegalParameter<br>    One or more parameters are illegal or are not specified.<br>    ProvisioningSchemeNotFound<br>    The specified provisioning scheme could not be located.<br>    UnableToRemoveProvisioningSchemeDueToAssociatedVM<br>    The provisioning scheme contained VMs and the 'ForgetVM' parameter was not specified.<br>    DatabaseError<br>    An error occurred in the service while attempting a database operation.<br>    DatabaseNotConfigured<br>    The operation could not be completed because the database for the service is not configured.<br>    ServiceStatusInvalidDb<br>    An error occurred in the service while attempting a database operation - communication with the database failed for<br>    for various reasons.<br>    CommunicationError<br>    An error occurred while communicating with the service.<br>    PermissionDenied<br>    The user does not have administrative rights to perform this operation.<br>    ConfigurationLoggingError<br>    The operation could not be performed because of a configuration logging error<br>    ExceptionThrown<br>    An unexpected error occurred.
