## Parameters
| Name   | Description | Required? | Pipeline Input | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ProvisioningSchemeName | The name of the provisioning scheme from which virtual machines will be removed. | true | true (ByPropertyName) |  |
| ProvisioningSchemeUid | The unique identifier for the provisioning scheme from which the virtual machines are removed. | true | false |  |
| VMName | List of VM names that will be removed from the provisioning scheme. | true | true (ByValue, ByPropertyName) |  |
| ForgetVM | The named VMs will only be removed from the provisioning scheme database, but will remain in the hypervisor. | false | false |  |
| RunAsynchronously | Indicates whether or not the command returns before it is complete. If this is specified, the command returns an identifier for the task that was created. This task can be monitored using the get-ProvTask command. | false | false | false |
| PurgeJobOnSuccess | Indicates that the task history is removed from the database when the task finishes. This cannot be specified for tasks that are run asynchronously. | false | false |  |
| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high-level operation this cmdlet call forms a part of. Citrix Studio and Director typically create high-level operations. PowerShell scripts can also wrap a series of cmdlet calls in a high-level operation by way of the Start-LogHighLevelOperation and Stop-LogHighLevelOperation cmdlets. | false | false |  |
| BearerToken | Specifies the bearer token assigned to the calling user | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller that the PowerShell snap-in connects to. You can provide this as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | LocalHost. When a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value becomes the default. |

## Notes
Only one long-running task for each provisioning scheme can be processed at a time.<br>    This task still operates if the hosting unit or VMs in the hypervisor are missing. This removes the data from the Citrix Machine Creation Services, but the VMs remain in the hypervisor.<br>    In the case of failure, the following errors can result.<br>    Error Codes<br>    -----------<br>    JobCreationFailed<br>    The requested task could not be started.<br>    DatabaseError<br>    An error occurred in the service while attempting a database operation.<br>    DatabaseNotConfigured<br>    The operation could not be completed because the database for the service is not configured.<br>    ServiceStatusInvalidDb<br>    An error occurred in the service while attempting a database operation. Communication with the database failed for<br>    for various reasons.<br>    WorkflowHostUnavailable<br>    The task could not be started because the database connection is inactive.<br>    CommunicationError<br>    An error occurred while communicating with the service.<br>    InvalidParameterCombination<br>    Both PurgeJobOnSuccess and RunAsynchronously were specified. When running asynchronously, the cmdlet terminates before the job does, so it cannot clean up the completed job.<br>    PermissionDenied<br>    The user does not have administrative rights to perform this operation.<br>    ConfigurationLoggingError<br>    The operation could not be performed because of a configuration logging error<br>    ExceptionThrown<br>    An unexpected error occurred. To locate more details, see the Windows event logs on the controller being used or examine the XenDesktop logs.<br>    The cmdlet is associated with a task of type RemoveVirtualMachine, and while active will move through the following operations (CurrentOperation field)<br>    ValidatingInputs<br>    RemovingVirtualMachines
