## Detailed Description
Provides the ability to update the parameters of an existing provisioning scheme.

This allows the following parameters to be updated:

Number of CPUs that will be used for VMs created from the provisioning scheme. Maximum amount of memory that will be used for VMs created from the provisioning scheme.

To change the name of the provisioning scheme see Rename-ProvScheme.

## Parameters
| Name   | Description | Required? | Pipeline Input | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ProvisioningSchemeName | The name of the provisioning scheme to be updated. | true | false |  |
| IdentityPoolName | The name of an identity pool to associate with the provisioning scheme, replacing the present one. | true | false |  |
| IdentityPoolUid | The identifier of an identity pool to associate with the provisioning scheme, replacing the present one. | true | false |  |
| ProvisioningSchemeUid | The identifier of the provisioning scheme to be updated. | true | false |  |
| VMCpuCount | The number of processors that virtual machines created from the provisioning scheme should use. | false | false |  |
| VMMemoryMB | The maximum amount of memory that virtual machines created from the provisioning scheme should use. | false | false |  |
| CustomProperties | The properties of the provisioning scheme that are specific to the target hosting infrastructure. | false | false |  |
| ServiceOffering | The name of the cloud service offering to use when creating machines. | false | false |  |
| PassThru | Returns the affected record. By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output. | false | false | False |
| LoggingId | Specifies the identifier of the high-level operation this cmdlet call forms a part of. Citrix Studio and Director typically create high-level operations. PowerShell scripts can also wrap a series of cmdlet calls in a high-level operation by way of the Start-LogHighLevelOperation and Stop-LogHighLevelOperation cmdlets. | false | false |  |
| BearerToken | Specifies the bearer token assigned to the calling user | false | false |  |
| AdminAddress | Specifies the address of a XenDesktop controller the PowerShell snap-in will connect to. You can provide this as a host name or an IP address. | false | false | Localhost. Once a value is provided by any cmdlet, this value becomes the default. |
