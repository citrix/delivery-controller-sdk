# Get-SfServiceInstance

   Gets the service instance entries for the Storefront Service.

## Syntax
```
Get-SfServiceInstance [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## Detailed Description
   Returns service interfaces published by instances of the Storefront Service. Each instance of a service publishes multiple interfaces with distinct interface types, and each of these interfaces is represented as a ServiceInstance object. Service instances can be used to register the service with a central configuration service so that other services can use the functionality.

You do not need to configure a database connection to use this command.

### Citrix.Storefront.Sdk.ServiceInstance
   The Get-SfServiceInstance command returns an object containing the following properties.<br>ServiceGroupUid <Guid><br>    Specifies the unique identifier for the service group of which the service is a member.<br>ServiceGroupName <String><br>    Specifies the name of the service group of which the service is a member.<br>ServiceInstanceUID <Guid><br>    Specifies the unique identifier for registered service instances, which are service instances held by and obtained from a central configuration service.  Unregistered service instances do not have unique identifiers.<br>ServiceType <String><br>    Specifies the service instance type.  For this service, the service instance type is always Sf.<br>Address<br>    Specifies the address of the service instance.  The address can be used to access the service and, when registered in the central configuration service, can be used by other services to access the service.<br>Binding<br>    Specifies the binding type that must be used to communicate with the service instance.  In this release of XenDesktop, the binding type is always 'wcf_HTTP_kerb'. This indicates that the service provides a Windows Communication Foundation endpoint that uses HTTP binding with integrated authentication.<br>Version<br>    Specifies the version of the service instance.  The version number is used to ensure that the correct versions of the services are used for communications.<br>ServiceAccount <String><br>    Specifies the Active Directory account name for the machine on which the service instance is running.  The account name is used to provide information about the permissions required for interservice communications.<br>ServiceAccountSid <String><br>    Specifies the Active Directory account security identifier for the machine on which the service instance is running.<br>InterfaceType <String><br>    Specifies the interface type.  Each service can provide multiple service instances, each for a different purpose, and the interface defines the purpose.  Available interfaces are:<br>        SDK - for PowerShell operations<br>        InterService - for operations between different services<br>        Peer - for communications between services of the same type<br>Metadata <Citrix.Storefront.Sdk.Metadata[]><br>     The collection of metadata associated with registered service instances, which are service instances held by and obtained from a central configuration service.  Metadata is not stored for unregistered service instances.## Notes
