# Set-Trustservicekeyrotation
Mark a service key as needing to be rotated
## Syntax
```
Set-TrustServiceKeyRotation -ServiceName <String> [-InstanceId <String>] [-PassThru] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]

Set-TrustServiceKeyRotation -ServiceKey <ServiceKey> [-PassThru] [-BearerToken <String>] [-AdminAddress <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
## Detailed Description
Mark a service key as needing to be rotated. Key rotation will not happen immediately.  Typically, it should take about an hour for the keys to be rotated but it can take longer if the service that owns the key is down or unable to contact the Trust Service.

Use Get-TrustServiceKey and look at the "LastUpdated" and "RotationNeeded" fields to determine when it was last rotated and if the Service Key has already been marked for Rotation.
